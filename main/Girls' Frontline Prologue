==Guide Reading==
===<big><big><big><big>Chapter 0</big></big></big></big>===
Agent: I have brought Death to your doorstep.<br />
Agent: Now, open your eyes...<br />
Agent: Look at me, Tactical Doll M4A1, look at me.<br />
Agent: It's time for your finale, and you must stay till the show is over.<br />
M4A1: Cough...<br />
M4A1: A...gent...<br />
Agent: Interesting. Even the look in your eyes is different from theirs in the face of Death.<br />
Agent: But this is the look I want. Show more shock! More indignation! More hatred!<br />
M4A1: Cough...cough...<br />
Agent: You've stolen something that's very important to Master. Do you think you can just leave?<br />
Agent: I'll kill you first, then your AR team, and those Griffin T-Dolls still slaving away for you.<br />
Agent: Very soon, they'll be completely as a loss, like infants who've lost their parents.<br />
Agent: They'll struggle blindly on the battlefield, and fall prey to us.<br />
Agent: You just have to die... and you will, in just a few more seconds.<br />
M16A1: ...Sorry, but she wont't be dying here.<br />
Agent: ...!<br />
M16A1: I'll spare you the wait! Go to hell right now,<br />
M16A1: Sangvis scum!<br />
M4A1: Cough...cough...<br />
M16: Yeah, thank me. Death's scythe missed you by a hair's breadth yet again.<br />
M4A1: Phew... M16, how is the situation outside? AR-15 and SOP-II are still...<br />
ST AR-15: We're back, but Sangvis reinforcements are here. We have to retreat soon.<br />
M4 SOPMOD II: The backup squad can hold them off for a while. Let's go!<br />
M16A1: M4, you all right issuing commands? You seem to be in pretty bad shape.<br />
M4A1: I am fine... cough... M16, please do some repairs on me. I will run a diagnostic on my command system first.<br />

===<big><big><big><big>Chapter 1</big></big></big></big>===
Ten minutes later...<br />
M4A1: It is fine. The tactical maps are intact. What about the comms system?<br />
Skorpion: Comms are functioning normally! We're hearing you loud and clear!<br />
M4A1: ...I am so sorry, but you will have to bring up the rear.<br />
PPSh-41: No problem, comrade. It's our duty.<br />
M4A1: ...Thank you. We shall finish evacuating as soon as possible.<br />
StG44: Let's move out! AR team, can you guys see the entire field from where you are?<br />

===<big><big><big><big>Chapter 2</big></big></big></big>===
M4A1: Hmm, I see Sangvis reinforcements fast approaching. Get into position as fast as you can!<br />
PPSh-41: Poger! Griffin back-up squad is ready!<br />
Skorpion: Here we go! I'm got gonna lose to those monsters.<br />
StG44: AR team, all of us are in position. Get ready to move yourself.<br />
M4A1: Understood. One last check on our destination, then we are moving out!<br />

===<big><big><big><big>Chapter 3</big></big></big></big>===
M4A1: We have to take our command post and deactivate the alarm at the exit.<br />
ST AR-15: The backup squad can't hold them off forever. We have to hurry!<br />

===<big><big><big><big>Chapter 4</big></big></big></big>===
StG44: The first wave of enemies have been annihilated. Thank you for your coordination, M4.<br />
M4A1: No problem. The next attack will come from your flank. Be careful.<br />
PPSh-41: Understood. Get ready for defense maneuvers!<br />

===<big><big><big><big>Chapter 5</big></big></big></big>===
PPSh41: Phew...<br />
PPSh41: Papasha here is safe. What about you, Skorpion?<br />
PPSh41: ...Skorpion? Skorpion VZ61 of Squad S61, please respond!<br />

===<big><big><big><big>Chapter 6</big></big></big></big>===
Skorpion: ...There! I'm done here! That was close!<br />
PPSh-41: Phew... That's great. We managed to fend off the first wave of attack.<br />
StG44: We should've bought a lot of time for the AR team. Well done guys!<br />

===<big><big><big><big>Chapter 7</big></big></big></big>===
Agent: Isn't it too early to sigh in relif?<br />
M4 SOPMOD II: It's that Sangvis! It's here again!<br />
Agent: Killing me once is truly commendable for trash dolls like you.<br />
Agent: This time I'm bringing more dummies. You'll be making their acquaintance soon.<br />
M4A1: Back-up squad, signals of powerful Sangvis units detected! Be careful!<br />
PPSh-41: Roger! Prepare for combat!<br />

===<big><big><big><big>Chapter 8</big></big></big></big>===
StG44: It is...over...?<br />
Agent: Indeed, Griffin trash.<br />
Agent: Apart from sullying my floor, you've achieved nothing.<br />
StG44: You dirty lumps of sheet metal... should've been thrown out long ago.<br />
Agent: Sadly, your employers didn't realize that until it was too late.<br />
StG44: Soon, the AR Team... will definitely make it out!<br />
Agent: It's no use. You've merely delayed out movements for a short time...<br />
Agent: ...And right now, we have all time in the world.<br />

===<big><big><big><big>Chapter 9</big></big></big></big>===
PPSh-41: Is that... the best we can do.<br />
Agent: It's over, Griffin leftovers. There's nothing left that you can do.<br />
PPSh-41: No, I... I can still... protect them...<br />
Agent: If you're the only one left to face your friends' broken parts, what can you do for them?<br />
Agent: No rush. We'll see that in no time.<br />

===<big><big><big><big>Chapter 10</big></big></big></big>===
Ar Team in retreat.<br />
M4A1: Hailing Griffin back-up squad. How are things on your end?<br />
Skorpion: Run... Go back and find... comman...<br />
Skorpion: ARGHHHHHH!<br />
M4A1: ?! Griffin squad! Are you all right?!<br />
Agent: Still moving, are't we? But this should be enough to make you drop dead for good<br />
Agent: ...?!<br />
Skorpion: ... The one that's gonna drop dead... is YOU!<br />
The sound of an explosion comes through the comms.<br />
M4A1: ...<br />
M4A1: The signal... got cut off...<br />
M4 SOPMOD II: Don't tell me... they...<br />
ST AR-15: ...Dammit!<br />
M16A1: ...Snap out of it, guys. They bought us this chance.<br />
M16A1: M4, seize that command post asap and deactivate the alarm.<br />
M16A1: ...M4?<br />
M4A1: ...?!<br />
M4A1: Ah, understood. We have to...<br />
M4A1: Sorry... I... I am just a little...<br />
M16A1: Remember, we are all just following orders. Just like them.<br />
M4A1: I understand... We must return with the 'data', at all cost...<br />

===<big><big><big><big>Chapter 11</big></big></big></big>===
M4 SOPMOD II: Phew... Can we catch our breath yet?<br />
ST AR-15: Not yet! There are still too many of them! We can't make it out!<br />
M16A1: Then let's switch to backup Plan C, just as we've agreed.<br />
M4A1: You mean... I return to Griffin HQ alone and ask for help?<br />
M16A1: Yeah. We'll scatter to draw their fire. That'll buy you some time.<br />
M4A1: But... if that sangvis is still alive, you'll...!<br />
ST AR-15: Stop dawdling, M4! This is the safest way!<br />
M4 SOPMOD II: That's right, you're our only hope!<br />
M4A1: ...Understood, Be careful.<br />
M16A1: All right! Everyone scatter and draw away the sangvis troops!<br />
M4A1: I WILL find a dependable commander. Wait for me.<br />
M4A1: I have to, for everyone's sake.<br />
System Report. No response from Tactical Doll Echelon [AR Team] for an extended period of time.<br />
Persica: ...Call request. Connect to Griffin HQ.<br />
Click.<br />
Middle-aged man: Things have been going terribly today. You'd better give me some good news, Persica.<br />
Persica: Good news... The AR Team got the data, but...<br />
Persica: We lost contact with then after they came under Sangvis ambush...<br />
Middle-aged man: (Sighs)... That's the T-Doll squad most capable of independent operation in all of Griffin, Persica.<br />
Persica: I know... No one knows better than me. That's why we must rescue them as soon as...<br />
Middle-aged man: The area they were headed to isn't under Griffin's jurisdiction. We can't just get in there.<br />
Persica: Is there... no other way? M4A1 and the others...<br />
Middle-aged man: I'll think of something, Persica, but remember...<br />
Middle-aged man: ...This time, you owe us one.<br />
Middle-aged man: Helian, tell me which Griffin commander is stationed closest to the area.<br />
...<br />
Helian: I just looked into it. The commander in Area S09 is a rookie.<br />
Middle-aged man: Well, isn't that just 'splendid'... How must field experience does the rookie have?<br />
Helian: According to the records, the commander has only just...<br />
Helian: ...reported for duty?<br />
