The '''ACG''' is an abbreviation of "'''A'''nime, '''C'''omics and '''G'''ames" widely used in [[Greater China]]. With the incrasing number of [[Otaku]], the term refers in particular to [[anime]], [[manga]] and [[video game]]s in Japan, with the video games usually referring to [[galgame]]s. As a general rule, it is not translated to Chinese characters. But if an old Chinese man don't speak English, you may say ''dòngmànyóu(xì)'', which writes{{zh-hans}}动漫游(戏) or{{zh-hant}}動漫遊(戲).

''Èr cìyuán'', which writes 二次元, is a term received from Japanese ''nijigen'', which writes 2次元 formally. In the origin, it means two-demension<ref>which is formally{{zh-hans}}二维 or{{zh-hant}}二維(''Èr wéi'') in Chinese</ref>, then [[jawiki:2次元#転用|''changed'']] to refers works based on two-demension space. With the market of ACG in PRC grows, ACG is used to describe this phenomenon in relative fields. In 2015, Tencent Anime brought concepts about '''core-Nijigen''' and '''pan-Nijigen''' in [[zhmoe:zhmoe:二次元经济|'''''Nijigen marketing''''']].

== Etymology ==

In 1995, a [[Taiwan]]ese fan of animation and comics using the name "AIplus" established a board at [[National Sun Yat-sen University]]'s BBS; the board was named the "ACG_Review Board", referring to animation, comics and games. It is considered the first appearance of the term "ACG".<ref>{{Cite book | author = CCSX | title = Dead or Alive──台灣阿宅啟示錄|trans_title=Dead or Alive — Revelation of Taiwanese Omonetaku| series=阿宅，你已經死了！ | location = Taiwan | publisher = 時報出版公司 | date = 24 August 2009 | pages = 31 |ISBN = 9789571350653| accessdate = 2011-10-14 | url = http://www.readingtimes.com.tw/readingtimes/ProductPage.aspx?gp=productdetail&cid=mcac%28SellItems%29&id=FZ0214 | language= Chinese}}</ref> Popularizing by Taiwanese anime and comics critique group [[Shuffle Alliance]], the arrangement of the three letters was stabilized, and the term became popular on the [[Chinese Mainland]], in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Taiwan]].

After [[light novel]]s, which were adapted from anime, comics and video games, became more popular, the term "ACGN" was coined. However, the term ACG is still used in the majority of situations and is generally thought to include light novels even without "N."

== In other regions ==

Japanese do not use the term ACG, though a similar concept is "MAG", meaning "Manga, Anime and Games". Japanese speakers usually use {{Nihongo|Nijigen|2次元||lit. "Two-dimensional space"}} to refer a series of anime and manga culture (containing [[light novel]]s and [[garage kit]]s). The {{Nihongo|[[Otaku]] culture|オタク文化|Otaku bunka}} refers to the related-[[subculture]],<ref>For example: [http://www.cyzo.com/2011/02/post_6557.html 朝日新聞までもが危惧し始めた「世界に広がるオタク文化」の幻想と危機的状況]</ref> while {{Nihongo|Otaku industry|オタク産業|Otaku sangyō}} refers to related industries.

The term ACG is not prevalent in English-speaking regions.
