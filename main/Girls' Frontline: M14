'''M14''' is a character from the SLG game '''[[Girls' Frontline]]''' developed by MicaTeam and published by SUNBORN Network Technology Co., Ltd. and its derivatives.

== Historical basis ==


The M14 rifle, officially the United States Rifle, 7.62 mm, M14, is an American automatic rifle that fires 7.62×51mm NATO (.308 in) ammunition. It became the standard-issued rifle for the U.S. military in 1959 replacing the M1 Garand rifle in the U.S. Army by 1961 and the U.S. Marine Corps by 1965 until being replaced by the M16 rifle beginning in 1964. The M14 was used by U.S. Army, Navy, and Marine Corps for basic and advanced individual training (AIT) from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s. 

The M14 rifle developed by Springfield Armory is essentially an improved M1 Garand firing the shorter 7.62x51mm NATO instead of the .30-06 cartridge used by the M1 Garand, and is fed by a 20-round detachable magazine instead of the 8-round en bloc clip found in the M1. The M14 also has a selector which enables the weapon to switch between semi- and full-auto (despite most of the M14 in the US military having a selector lock in the place of the lever to lock the weapon in semi-auto). The angle at which the bolt locks into the barrel is different from the M1 Garand to improve reliability. The M14 is designed as a battle rifle with squad automatic weapon, match rifle, sniper rifle and ceremonial variants. The M14 was used as a battle rifle from the Cuban Missile Crisis all the way to the year 2002 in Afghanistan.

The M14 was the last American battle rifle issued in quantity to U.S. military personnel. It was replaced by the M16 assault rifle, a lighter weapon using a smaller caliber intermediate cartridge. The M14 rifle remains in limited service in all branches of the U.S. military as an accurized competition weapon, a ceremonial weapon by honor guards, color guards, drill teams and ceremonial guards, and sniper rifle/designated marksman rifle. Civilians models in semi-automatic are used for hunting, plinking, target shooting, and shooting competitions. 
The M14 is the basis for the M21 and M25 sniper rifles which were largely replaced by the M24 Sniper Weapon System. A new variant of the M14, the Mk 14 Enhanced Battle Rifle has been in service since 2002.

== Trivia ==
*Despite the mediocre maximum damage of 108, M14 boasts the highest DPS (at '''92.88'''/sec or '''148.608'''/sec after skills) among '''all 3-star RF''''s (without equipment or third-party buffs), ranking 7th among all RF's (and 5th/4th after skills (barring those with non-ROF/damage buffs) depending on night/day) currently in the game.
**This made her one of the best RF's to start with in the game.
**During Closed Beta of the CN build, M14 possessed some of the best stats both in level 1 and 100, second only to [[Girls' Frontline: Lee-Enfield|Lee-Enfield]], sparking a meme that there were two kinds of RF's in the game--one being M14, the other being non-M14.

{{Hide|Title=''I don't mean you...''|Text=[[File:M14在座各位.jpg|300px]]}}

*M14 received a nerf in RoF during Open Beta, inferior to most 5-star RF's. However, the aforementioned high DPS makes her a frequent MVP in battles.

*M14's illustrator once mentioned about her fondness of hearing an ear picked or grinded with teeth.

*Her quotes reflect M14 being one of the few dolls who seem to be not fond of the commander touching her too often.
**Her quotes may also hint that M14 herself is based on the Springfield '''M1A''', the semi-automatic civilian version of the M14 instead of the original M14.

*M14 as a doll is classified as an RF despite her weapon being chambered in the full-power 7.62x51mm NATO and being capable of full-auto firing, in contrast with G3 and FAL.
**This may be an allusion to the fact that most M14's due to their uncontrollable recoil in full-auto were locked to semi-auto to facilitate (relatively) accurate firing.
**M14's high rate of fire (highest among all RF's) at '''43''' (or ~1.16 s/shot) may also be alluding to this fact.

*In the (soon to come in EN build) '''Neural Upgrade''' teaser first released in December 22, 2016 (for the CN build), three partially shaded illustration were leaked by MicaTeam, leading to the belief that the first ones to receive Neural Upgrades would be [[Girls' Frontline: M14|M14]], [[Girls' Frontline: G43|G43]] and [[Girls'  Frontline: FF FN49|FF FN49]] (despite only the FF FN49 received her upgrade in the CN build).

{{Hide|Title=Screenshot|Text=[[File:改造卫星.jpg|800px|center|thumb]]}}

*Despite the most suitable choice for M14 to "upgrade" into wielding an M21, the latter has already been included in the game.
*This means that if M14 is to actually have a Neural Upgrade, she would have the highest likelihood of being upgraded into a doll wielding the M14 EBR.

*Despite said speculation, the silhouette of the weapon in the screenshot appears to not have received a significant change.

**Said illustration is officially included in the official artbook first introduced in early 2017 in Chinese.

*M14 as of the current CN build still hasn't received a Neural Upgrade yet.

*M14 appears to have received a variety of commendations judging from the ribbons on her uniform (shown below)

[[File:M14 左胸勋略.png|无框]][[File:M14勋章 未确认.jpg|500px|left|thumb|<center>Ribbons found on M14's uniform, question marks ("?") represent unidentified ribbon due to resolution. Ribbon images taken from Wikipedia.</center>]]

:Upper left: The '''Silver Star Medal''' given to members of the US Armed Forced for gallantry in action against an enemy of the United States.

:Upper right: (Suspected to be) The '''Bronze Star Medal''' given to members of the US Armed Forces for either heroic achievement, heroic service, meritorious achievement or meritorious service in a combat zone.  

:Middle left: The '''Commendation Medal''' (US Army variant) given for sustained acts of heroism or meritorious service or valorous actions in direct contact with an enemy where such actions are of a lesser degree than required for the award of the '''Bronze Star Medal'''.

:Middle center: (Suspected to be) The '''Good Conduct Medal''' given to any active duty enlisted member of the US military who completes three consecutive years of "honorable and faithful service".

:Middle right: The '''National Defense Service Medal''' given to service members who served honorably during a designated time of which a "national emergency" had been declared during a time of war or conflict, or any other periods the Secretary of Defense designates.

:Lower left/Lower middle: ?

:Lower right: (Suspected to be) The '''Navy Unit Commendation''' given to any Navy or Marine Corps unit that has distinguished itself by outstanding heroism in action against the enemy, but insufficient to justify the award of the Presidential Unit Citation {{Spoiler|despite the need for Unit Commendation ribbons to be worn on the right.}}
