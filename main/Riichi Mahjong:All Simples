== Introduction ==
All simples is an extremely common yaku in riichi mahjong. The occurrence rate of this yaku is the second highest among all yakus, right after [[Riichi Mahjong:Riichi|riichi]].

A winning hand contains this yaku when it has no [[Riichi Mahjong:Tiles|terminals or honors]].

Due to its simplicity, it can only add 1 han to one's hand. However, thanks to the existence of [[Riichi Mahjong:Dora|doras]], one can simply reach [[Riichi Mahjong:Points Calculation|mangan]] with a combination of tanyao and 3 or more doras.

For the same reason, all simples is preferred and welcomed by newbies. Though it's easy to make a hand of "Tanyao nomi''(''{{lj|タンヤオのみ}}''tan'yao nomi, only tan'yao)''", it's not that frequent to see in high-level tables for its low cost-effectiveness.

All simples is also frequently used when one wants to end another's dealer or block others' high-cost hands. There's this saying in China, "No matter how good your hand is, a tan'yao will end it all({{lang|zh-cn|功夫再高，也怕断幺}})".
