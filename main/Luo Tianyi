'''Luo Tianyi (Chinese:{{ruby|洛天依|Luò Tiānyī|zh-hans|en}})''' is a Chinese [[Vocaloid]] formerly {{fact|developed by Bplats, Inc.}} and created in collaboration with Shanghai HENIAN Information Technology Co. Ltd. Her voice was provided by the Chinese voice actress {{ILP|Shan Xin|山新}}.

She was originally released in July 2012 for use with the VOCALOID3 engine, the first released Vocaloid with a Chinese voicebank. 

In 2017, her Chinese voicebank was updated to VOCALOID4; a Japanese voicebank was also released, with voice from Shan Xin and Japanese Singer {{ILP|Kano|鹿乃}}.

==Official Character Description==
Luo Tianyi is a somewhat shy girl who is sensitive to others' emotions. She admires earlier [[Vocaloid]]s who have created history in the human world; she dreamed to be a Vocaloid that can touch hearts and spread happiness with her voice.

All of a sudden, she was summoned one day with an important mission and came to the human world as a Vocaloid.

She has the gentle empathy in that she will shed tear for others; and the staunch persistence in that she will not give up no matter the obstacles.

Since she is new to the human world, she knows nothing about human language. She couldn't talk to others and could only express her feeling and melody in her heart by singing.

==Character Design==

==Secondary Persona==
The chapter below overviews some famous secondary personas of Luo Tianyi, their origin, and their influence.

===[[Foodie]]===
Before the release of the V3 voicebank, the official website of Vocaloid China uploaded demo songs of Luo Tianyi. One of them is ''[[A Millennial Menu of China]]'' produced by [[H.K.kun]].

The song told a story of Luo Tianyi and [[Yuezheng Ling]] <del>who paid the bills</del> traveling around China and tasting different foods. 

On 3 July 2012, the day after the release, [[the Nightmare of Xmas Eve]] posted the [[PV]] of ''A Millennial Menu of China'' to {{ILP|Bilibili|Bilibili}}. The song's cute and charming lyrics, melody, and music video lead the audiences into a journey through Chinese cuisines; it had a great reaction. This song became the first Luo Tianyi song to reach {{ILP|Vocaloid Hall of Fame|Vocaloid殿堂曲|display=100,000 views}}, and has gained {{ILP|Vocaloid Myth|Vocaloid传说曲|display=1,000,000 views}} in 2016.

In the discription of the song, Luo Tianyi was called "Number one foodie sama in the world" <ref>The name is a [[neta]] of {{lang|zh-hans|世界第一的公主殿下}} (lit. No.1 Pricess sama in the world), a nickname of [[Hatsune Miku]] that derived from the commonly used Chinese title of her song ''[[World is Mine]]''.</ref>. Influenced by ''A Millennial Menu of China'', the foodie trait became almost an intergral part of Luo's persona; works like ''{{ILP|Feeding Song for Luo Tianyi|洛天依投食歌}}'' were produced, and the fan base of Luo often proclaim themselves as the Foodie Party, with ''A Millennial Menu of China'' being '''the Song of the Party'''<ref>which is also a [[neta]]. Fans of [[Hatsune Miku]] call ''{{ILP|Miku-Miku ni Shite Ageru|把你给MikuMiku掉}}'' their Song of the Party, so ''A Millennial Menu of China'' is promoted likewise, a nod to its importance to Luo Tianyi.</ref>.

Henian soon recognized foodie as part of the official character persona; steamed stuffed bun was deemed her favorite food. Luo Tianyi advertised for brands like Three Squirrels, Mirinda, Vita lemon tea, Pizza Hut, and Nescafe, and great songs were produced for these commercials.

Notably, [[Shan Xin]], the source of Luo's voicebank, is known for her strenth and appetite; there were even urban legends of Shan Xin eating her fans. <del>Thus the foodie trait could also be inherited from her dad. <ref>This is not a mistake: Chinese sometimes jokingly use male pronouns on females to poke fun at their tomboyish qualities; many female use male pronouns on themselves in the same spirit.</ref></del>

=== Traditional suit ===
Elements in Luo's character design made illustrators prefer to add some elements from traditional Chinese culture; thus, traditional Chinese dresses,  including "{{ILP|Hanfu|汉服}}" and "{{ILP|Cheongsam|旗袍}}", are common in illustrations featuring Luo.

Luo performed twice on [[CCTV]]: once in 2018, on ''Everlasting Classics'' S1E5, when she sang "Danyuan Ren Changjiu" (Chinese: ''{{lang|zh-hans|但愿人长久}}''） with Wang Peiyu, a famous Bejing Opera performer; the other time in 2020, on the ''Little [[Spring Festival Gala|Chunwan]]'' when she sang "Jasmine" with Dimash, a Kazakh singer. In both performances, Luo wore traditional dresses.

According to ratings and media coverages of these programmes, traditional suit is probably the most well-known and well-accepted dress of Luo, even more famous than the dresses from the official character designs since those has yet to appear on national media like CCTV.

=== [[Reversal]] ===
The persona of {{ILP|Reversal|黑化}} appeared in some songs; and it is favored by quite a few creaters because of the gap between it and the cute original persona.

No one knows the origin of this persona, and the earliest clearly reverse song of Luo Tianyi is '''probably''' ''[[Heart bitten]]'' posted on Aug. 1<sup>st</sup> on [[Bilibili]] by [[PoKeR]].

{{Spoiler|However, because reversal songs often has "horrifying" or "violent" elements, it's limited by the goverment and becoming more and more rare.}}
