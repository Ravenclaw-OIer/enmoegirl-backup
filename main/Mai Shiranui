'''Mai Shiranui''' (不知火 舞, ''Shiranui Mai'') is a character from both the ''[[Fatal Fury (series)|Fatal Fury]]'' and ''[[The King of Fighters (series)|The King of Fighters]]'' series of fighting games by [[SNK]] (now SNK Playmore).

She was originally not planned to be included in ''Fatal Fury'' at all, as her fighting style was created for a different male ninja. When developers shifted their focus to including an idol character into the series, they decided to scrap the Shiranui man for Mai. Her characteristic "bounce" was loosely modified from a kunoichi (female ninja) method of assassination: to be sensual to their unassuming prey before they strike. According to an issue of [[Neo Geo Freak]], her breasts were modeled after [[Wikipedia:Fumie Hosokawa|Fumie Hosokawa]] and her bottom is modeled after Ai Iijima; both women were famous idols at the time.

Mai was rated #4 in GameSpy.com's "Top Ten Babes in Games" feature and #5 in Game Informer's "Top Ten Hottest Girls of the 16-Bit era." In the character popularity poll on Neo Geo Freak's website, she was voted as the fifth favorite character with a total of 2,380 votes. Along with the many figures and merchandise that have been made in her image, she has made an outside game appearance in the spin off series [http://queensblade.wikia.com/wiki/Mai_Shiranui Queens Gate].

==History==
===Fatal Fury===
[[File:Mai-ff2.jpg|thumb|left|Mai in Fatal Fury 2.]]

Mai Shiranui is the granddaughter of Hanzo Shiranui, master of ninjitsu and Koppo-ken. Mai learned from her father the secrets of Ninjitsu. She had met Andy during this time who had come to train under her grandfather. Mai then had to take alternate courses from her grandfather's friend, [[Jubei Yamada]] in ninjitsu. At first, Mai was uninterested in Andy and only thought of him as another callous man only interested in his training. It wasn't until he gave her a present on her birthday that she saw him in another light and eventually fell in love with him.

She spends much of the series endlessly pursuing Andy and fantasizing various daydreams about their wedding. When developers were asked about her whereabouts during ''[[Garou: Mark of the Wolves|Mark of Wolves]]'', they chose not to answer the question directly. However, they did divulge that she still loves Andy — as she always has — ten years later.

===The King of Fighters===
During nearly every King of Fighters tournament, Mai pesters Andy to enter and form a team with her. Upset at his refusals and choice to join a separate team, she forms an all women team with the help of [[Yuri Sakazaki|Yuri]] and [[King]]. In the following years her teammates change, but she remains firm to enter the tournament to help encourage King and her fellow team members and to prove to Andy the error of his ways. In King of Fighters 99, she is finally able to join the tournament in the same team as Andy. However, in the following tournament was asked to step out to allow [[Blue Mary]] investigate a case. Denied again, she is angered by the request and joins the Women's team again and has remained a reoccurring member ever since. In the various team endings, she is often celebrating the team's victory at King's bar or fantasizing about Andy.

Mai, who feels that a KOF tournament isn't complete without her, decides to enter the KOF XIII with her first KOF teammates. She isn't upset at Andy while making her choice, content to enter a tournament with both her and him in it once more.

==Personality==
Mai is a very cheerful and temperamental girl. She can tend to also be somewhat of an airhead and admires any kind beauty or attractiveness, which sometimes comes across as being vain. She also at times compares attractive boys who flirt with her or acknowledge her beauty to Andy, acknowledging their attractiveness but ending with a comment saying they're 'not as cute as Andy'.

Like many girls, she dreams to get married with her prince charming. She found that same Prince Charming in Andy and self-proclaimed herself his fiancé, which at times, have creeped out Andy himself. A notable example of this is her intro with Andy in KOF97, proposing to Andy outright in a wedding dress, or scaring Andy with a mock child doll in KOF2002. Despite this, Andy mutually acknowledges her love, but prefers to keep quiet about it.

Although her peppy fighting persona suggests otherwise, Mai is actually a traditional and ideal [[Wikipedia:Yamato Nadeshiko|Japanese beauty]]. However, her pride as a Shiranui ninja and infatuation with Andy usually keeps her from fitting the mold 100% of the time.

==Powers==
*'''Pyrokinesis:''' Mai is able to create and control fire. She cannot control flames she didn't create however and is not immune to other types of fire.
**'''Create Fire:''' Mai can create fire.
**'''Fire Attacks:''' Mai can infuse her attacks with fire. She can also completely cloak herself with her flames.
**'''Fire Channel:''' Mai can channel fire through her clothes, weapon and anything she touches.
**'''Fire Burst:''' Mai can cause explosions and eruptions of fire.
*'''Aerial Control: '''Mai has the ability to temporarily stay airborne and control her movements in the air. This allows her to float, glide, change directions in mid-air or gain temporary flight.
*'''Hidden weapons:''' Mai can hide/pull out infinite weapons and items from her clothing and cleavage, from seemingly nowhere as no space visible. She keeps at least one fan (her weapon of choice) with her that can't be seen. She also sometimes carries clothes, giant fans, and usually an umbrella.
*'''Bushin:''' Mai can temporarily project shadow images of herself and her weapon.

==Skills==
*'''Changing:''' With only one gesture, Mai can change clothes within a second.
*'''Climbing:''' Due to her ninja training, Mai is an expert with climbing surfaces.
*'''Stealth:''' Also because of her training, Mai is a master of stealth.

==Fighting Style==
Mai uses the Shiranui-ryuu form of ninjutsu combined with her fire powers to fight.

Her style resembles normal ninjutsu with more graceful and majestic moves, somewhat in reference to traditional Japanese dance. She also uses paper fans as weapons, integrating them into her combat technique and using them to perform several combinations and moves. Her clothing, specifically, the tassle on her ninja garb, is also used to attack the opponent.
