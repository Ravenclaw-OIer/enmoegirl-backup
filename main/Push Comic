A significant veteran comics artist from Hsinchu, Taiwan, Push Comic is currently the Assistant Professor of Shih Chien University, specialising in comics and multimedia creation, toy figure design and column writing. He is also an art competition judge and the director of NIKE creative exhibition. His offbeat sci-fi comics, underscored with strong tendency towards the European BD style, receive high praise in France. The symbols and codes hidden in his comics always engage his fans in some mystery games.

Push Comic was selected to participate in the exhibition presented by Ministry of Culture in the Taiwan Pavilion at the [[Angoulême International Comics Festival]] in France in 2012 and 2013. In 2012, he was even invited to France to present a solo exhibition at the Montpellier New Comic Festival, and received the Special Jury Award. In the same year, he also participated in the [[Chambêry International Comics Festival]]. As a well-recognised artist, Push Comic has successfully established reputation for Taiwanese comics on the international stage while fostering comics exchange between Taiwan and France.
