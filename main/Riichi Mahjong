== Brief Introduction ==

Riichi mahjong is one of the most popular games in Japan. In recent years, thanks to anime works such as [[Saki]], its international popularity has therefore increased.

Riichi mahjong got is name from one of its important rules - [[Riichi Mahjong:Riichi|Riichi]] (Japanese: {{lj|リーチ}} or {{lj|立直}}).

The number of players in a game of riichi mahjong is usually 3 or 4. At the beginning of the game, all players are given 13 tiles (14 for the dealer). They needed to ''draw'' tiles or ''call'' for tiles to construct a ''winning hand'' with at least 1 ''yaku'', and win points calculated by ''han'' and ''fu''. When the game ends, players calculate their rankings or total points to decide who's the winner, who's the second place, etc.
