'''''Doki Doki Literature Club!''''' is a 2017 American [[visual novel]] developed by Team Salvato for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]], and [[Linux]]. The game was initially distributed through [[itch.io]], and later became available on [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. The story follows a male high school student who joins the school's literature club and interacts with its four female members. The game features a mostly linear story, with some alternative scenes and endings depending on the choices the player makes. While the game appears at first glance to be a lighthearted [[dating sim]]ulator, it is in fact a [[metafiction]]al [[psychological horror]] game that extensively breaks the [[fourth wall]].

The game was developed in an estimated two-year period by a team led by Dan Salvato, known previously for his modding work for ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]''. According to Salvato, the inspiration for the game came from his mixed feelings toward [[anime]] and a fascination for surreal and unsettling experiences. Upon its release, ''Doki Doki Literature Club!'' received positive critical attention for its successful use of horror elements and unconventional nature within the visual novel genre.

==Gameplay==
[[File:DDLCPoemCreation.jpg|left|thumb|The poem writing minigame in ''Doki Doki Literature Club!'']]
''Doki Doki Literature Club!'' is a visual novel. As such, its gameplay has a low level of interactivity and consists of scenes with static two-dimensional images of characters in a first-person perspective. The narration and dialogue are presented in the form of accompanying text. The narration is provided by the game's protagonist, a member of the titular literature club, to which he was invited by his childhood friend Sayori.<ref name="RPGFan">{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/index.html |title=RPGFan Review—''Doki Doki Literature Club'' |last=Fenner |first=Robert |publisher=RPGFan |date=December 24, 2017 |accessdate=February 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006155112/http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/Doki_Doki_Literature_Club/index.html |archive-date=October 6, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="PCGamer">{{cite magazine |title=''Doki Doki Literature Club!'' hides a gruesome horror game under its cute surface |last=Wright |first=Steven |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/doki-doki-literature-club-hides-a-gruesome-horror-game-under-its-cute-surface/ |magazine=[[PC Gamer]] |date=October 26, 2017 |accessdate=October 26, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027074729/http://www.pcgamer.com/doki-doki-literature-club-hides-a-gruesome-horror-game-under-its-cute-surface/ |archive-date=October 27, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="GameGrin">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamegrin.com/reviews/doki-doki-literature-club-review/ |title=''Doki Doki Literature Club'' Review |first=Billy | last=Clarke |date=February 14, 2018 |publisher=GameGrin |accessdate=March 30, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613203809/https://www.gamegrin.com/reviews/doki-doki-literature-club-review/ |archive-date=June 13, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> At certain points, the player will be prompted to make decisions that determine the course of subsequent events.

The protagonist is invited by his cheerful [[childhood sweetheart]], Sayori, to join their high school's literature club as a remedy for his insular nature.<ref name="RPGFan"/><ref name="PCGamer"/><ref name="GameGrin"/> The protagonist reluctantly agrees to her proposal and meets the other members of the club: the assertive Natsuki, the shy Yuri, and the bubbly club president Monika.<ref name="RPGFan"/><ref name="GameGrin"/><ref name="GameRevolution"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Get to Know Your Fellow Lovers Of Writing With ''Doki Doki Literature Club!'' |last=Couture |first=Joel |url=https://www.siliconera.com/2017/10/13/get-know-fellow-lovers-writing-doki-doki-literature-club/ |publisher=Silicon Era |date=October 13, 2017 |accessdate=October 18, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816112633/http://www.siliconera.com/2017/10/13/get-know-fellow-lovers-writing-doki-doki-literature-club/ |archive-date=August 16, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The protagonist writes and shares poems with his new club-mates and deepens his relationships with them.

Realizing that something has happened to her, the protagonist rushes to Sayori's home, where he discovers that she has <!-- NOT "hung". See the page [[Hanging]]: "In this specialized meaning of the common word hang, the past and past participle is hanged instead of hung." -->[[Suicide by hanging|hanged herself]], and the game abruptly ends.<ref name="IGNJapan"/><ref name="PCGamesN"/>

The player is sent back to the main menu, with all previous save files erased.<ref name="Polygon1">{{cite web |title=''Doki Doki Literature Club'' is an uncontrollably horrific visual novel |last=Rose |first=Victoria |url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/22/16512204/doki-doki-literature-club-pc-explained |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=October 22, 2017 |accessdate=February 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023003236/https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/22/16512204/doki-doki-literature-club-pc-explained |archive-date=October 23, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The narrative repeats upon the start of a new game, but Sayori is glaringly absent; her name and dialogue are [[Mojibake|rendered illegible]], and the characters do not remember her existence.

Aside from the game's frequent distortions, the normally calm and shy Yuri becomes gradually unstable, possessive and prone to [[self-harm]].<ref name="IGNJapan"/> Yuri's decline in sanity culminates in the act of giving the protagonist a "poem" that is indecipherable and covered in blood and other bodily fluids. When Monika seems to be callously dismissing this anomalous behavior, Natsuki secretly passes the protagonist a message under the guise of a poem that begs him to seek help for Yuri, only to be immediately manipulated into telling the protagonist to disregard the message and devote his attention solely to Monika. After a heated quarrel over who the protagonist will help with the school festival, Yuri ejects Monika and Natsuki from the room and privately confesses her love for the protagonist. Whether or not the protagonist accepts Yuri's confession, she commits suicide by repeatedly stabbing herself.<ref name="PCGamesN"/> Due to the game's broken [[Scripting language|script]], the protagonist is stuck motionless in the room with Yuri's decaying cadaver over the course of a weekend. Natsuki returns upon the weekend's conclusion, but is horrified and nauseated by the sight of Yuri's body and flees the scene. Monika appears and apologizes to the protagonist for the "boring" weekend he had spent, and begins a display of compensation by deleting Yuri and Natsuki's character files from the game and sending the player back to the main menu.<ref name="IGNJapan"/>

A new file is started automatically, and the protagonist is placed in a room with Monika seated across from him. Monika reveals that she is a self-aware video game character who has the ability to manipulate and delete other character files, which she used to alter the behavior of her club-mates in an unsuccessful bid to make them unlikable and prevent their confessions of love to the protagonist. She expresses her loneliness from being relegated to a fruitless supporting role within an empty world where her only company had been "autonomous personalities" designed only to fall in love with the protagonist, and she confesses her own love not to the protagonist character, but directly to the player.<ref name="IGNJapan"/><ref name="PCGamesN"/> Monika will sit and talk to the player indefinitely about various topics until the player manually enters the game's [[Directory (computing)|directory]] and deletes Monika's character file. Monika initially lashes out at the player, but ultimately forgives them and remorsefully repents by restoring the game and the characters excluding herself.

===Endings===
Depending on the course of action taken by the player, the game can come to three possible conclusions. The standard ending sees Sayori introducing herself as the president of the literature club and thanking the player for getting rid of Monika. As she adopts Monika's possessive characteristics, Monika intervenes via text prompt and deletes Sayori to save the player. Monika deletes the game over the course of the credits, and the game concludes with a note from Monika, stating that she has disbanded the literature club because "no happiness can be found" in it.<ref name="IGNJapan"/>

A more positive ending occurs if the player has viewed all of the optional scenes in a single playthrough, which requires saving and loading at several points before witnessing Sayori's initial suicide.<ref name="Twinfinite">{{cite web |url=https://twinfinite.net/2017/12/doki-doki-literature-club-endings/ |title=''Doki Doki Literature Club'': How to Get All Endings | first=Jamie | last=Payne |date=December 7, 2017 |publisher=Twinfinite |accessdate=March 30, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002065553/https://twinfinite.net/2017/12/doki-doki-literature-club-endings/ |archive-date=October 2, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Sayori instead expresses her gratitude to the player for emotionally supporting all the club members, tearfully bids farewell and assures the player that all the club members love them before deleting the game herself. After the credits, the player is presented with a message from the game's developer, Dan Salvato.<ref name="AllGamers">{{cite web |url=https://allgamers.com/article/3654/doki-doki-literature-club-how-to-get-the-best-ending-fulfilling-ending |title=''Doki Doki Literature Club'': How to Get the Best Ending, Fulfilling Ending |first=Larryn | last=Bell |date=January 3, 2018 |publisher=AllGamers |accessdate=March 30, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002064946/https://allgamers.com/article/3654/doki-doki-literature-club-how-to-get-the-best-ending-fulfilling-ending |archive-date=October 2, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

If the player preemptively deletes Monika's file from the directory before starting the game, Sayori is made the default leader of the club. Upon realizing the true nature of the game and her role in it, Sayori panics and forcefully closes the game. Opening the game again will display an image of Sayori having hanged herself. If this image is left on screen for ten minutes, a line of text will appear next to Sayori's corpse reading either: "Now everyone can be happy." or "Nothing is real."<ref name="Twinfinite"/>

==Development and release==
''Doki Doki Literature Club'' was developed by American programmer Dan Salvato over the course of approximately two years, and is his debut title in the video game industry.<ref name=interview>{{cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/doki-doki-literature-clubs-horror-was-born-from-a-love-1819724999 |title=''Doki Doki Literature Club'''s Horror Was Born From A Love-Hate Relationship With Anime |last=Jackson |first=Gita |date=October 20, 2017 |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=October 29, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021235436/https://kotaku.com/doki-doki-literature-clubs-horror-was-born-from-a-love-1819724999 |archive-date=October 21, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Prior to its release, Salvato was known for creating the ''FrankerFaceZ'' extension for [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]],<ref name=interview/> his [[Mod (video gaming)|modding]] work in the ''[[Super Smash Bros]]'' scene,<ref>{{cite web |title=Powerful mod adds replay feature to ''Super Smash Bros.

Salvato sought to create a title that would attract the player's attention regardless of how they personally view anime.<ref name=interview/>

Discussing the horror elements of the game, Salvato explained that he was inspired by "things that are scary because they make you uncomfortable, not because they shove scary-looking things in your face."<ref name=interview/> To achieve this, Salvato developed the façade of a cute setting, which would break down over time along with the behavior of the characters, and eventually the role of one evil character who had seized control of the game from the player would be revealed. In creating the game's horror elements, Salvato drew inspiration from ''[[Yume Nikki]]'' and ''[[Eversion (video game)|Eversion]]'', and emphasized to his team that he wanted the market for visual novels to become much more daring and less reliant on the same plot concepts.<ref name="Concept3">Salvato, Dan (2017) ''Doki Doki Literature Club!'' Concept Art Booklet, p. 3</ref> The game's characters were based around standard anime archetypes and were given Japanese names to emphasize a pseudo-Japanese atmosphere characteristic of Western-produced visual novels. The sole exception to this format is Monika, who received an English name as a hint to her individual nature compared to the other characters.<ref name="Concept4">Salvato, Dan (2017) ''Doki Doki Literature Club!'' Concept Art Booklet, p. 4</ref>

[[File:DDLC_Character_Sketches.png|thumb|right|The prototypical versions of the cast of ''Doki Doki Literature Club'' were created by Dan Salvato in a free online program for creating anime characters.]]
Because Salvato lacked artistic skill, he used a free online anime-creation program to create the initial character designs and applied these designs in test versions of the game.<ref name="Concept5">Salvato, Dan (2017) ''Doki Doki Literature Club!'' Concept Art Booklet, p. 5</ref> Salvato recognized that a product of such quality would not satisfy potential players,<ref name="Concept5"/> so he made a request to his friend, a translator for [[Sekai Project]], for sketches of school uniforms and hairstyles for the characters.<ref name="Concept11">Salvato, Dan (2017) ''Doki Doki Literature Club!'' Concept Art Booklet, p. 11</ref>  Salvato then handed initial visual development over to Kagefumi, who left the project very early on. After Kagefumi's departure from the project, Salvato contacted the freelance artist Satchel, who created the final character [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], over the course of a few months.<ref name="Satchely"/> The sprites were created in several parts to give the poses more variety.<ref name="Concept18">Salvato, Dan (2017) ''Doki Doki Literature Club!'' Concept Art Booklet, p. 18</ref> The background images were originally created as three-dimensional models, and then processed by the artist VelinquenT.<ref name="Concept20">Salvato, Dan (2017) ''Doki Doki Literature Club!''

Salvato also composed the game's score.<ref name="GameCredits">{{cite video game |title=Doki Doki Literature Club! |developer=Team Salvato |date=September 22, 2017 |platform=Windows |level=End credits}}</ref> The introductory composition, "Doki Doki Literature Club!", is primarily performed by [[piano]] and [[flute]] with accompaniment by [[string instrument]]s. The composition "Okay, Everyone!" has five different versions, four of which are performed by different musical instruments that represent each of the four female characters. Monika's version emphasizes the piano, Yuri's version uses [[pizzicato]] and [[harp]]s, Natsuki's version is played by [[xylophone]] and [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], and Sayori's is played by [[ukulele]]. The game's score is generally calm and serene with the exception of two tracks, "Sayo-nara" and "Just Monika", which are ominous in tone.<ref name="OST">{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/ddlc-ost/index.html |title=''Doki Doki Literature Club!''

In its first three months of release, ''Doki Doki Literature Club!'' was downloaded over one million times,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/12/11/doki-doki-literature-club-hits-1-million-downloads |title=''Doki Doki Literature Club'' Hits 1 Million Downloads |last=Barnett |first=Brian |date=December 11, 2017 |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=December 16, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216233849/http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/12/11/doki-doki-literature-club-hits-1-million-downloads |archive-date=December 16, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and exceeded two million downloads about a month later.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/doki-doki-literature-club/doki-doki-literature-club-player-numbers |title=''Doki Doki Literature Club!'' surpasses two million downloads |last=Jones |first=Ali |date=January 15, 2018 |publisher=[[PCGamesN]] |accessdate=January 15, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828154317/https://www.pcgamesn.com/doki-doki-literature-club/doki-doki-literature-club-player-numbers |archive-date=August 28, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The game was received positively by critics, and accumulated a score of 78/100 on Metacritic based on 7 reviews.<ref name="MC"/>

Steven T. Wright of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' described the game as "a post-modern love letter to the genre it represents", and compared its deconstructive quality to ''[[Undertale]]'' and ''[[Pony Island]]''.<ref name="PCGamer"/> Robert Fenner of RPGFan noted that traditionally, major visual novel developers such as [[Key (company)|Key]] and [[Mages (company)|5pb.]] produced lengthy day-by-day narratives of a standard anime protagonist's relationships with their supporting cast. According to Fenner, previous attempts to revise the format, such as ''[[Hatoful Boyfriend]]'' and ''[[Higurashi no Naku Koro ni]]'', could not escape the conventions of their genre and fully reveal their dramatic potential. He then declared that ''Doki Doki Literature Club!'' had succeeded in this field by making unusual use of the [[Ren'Py]] engine and providing unexpected plot twists.<ref name="RPGFan"/>

Reviewers emphasized that the game achieves its surprising impact on the player due to its outward resemblance to typical [[eroge]] games: it has a pronounced anime style in its character design,<ref name="RPGFan"/><ref name="RockPaperShotgun"/> and the game's goal is to develop a relationship with one of the characters.<ref name="Polygon1"/><ref name="Kotaku"/> In addition, the characters consist of anime stereotypes whose behavior is sparsely displayed through their sprites,<ref name="GameGrin"/> and the game's musical accompaniment is light, bouncy, gentle and playful.<ref name="RPGFan"/><ref name="PCGamer"/> According to critics, these aspects combined to create the impression of a standard visual novel that would prompt the player to become attached to the characters.<ref name="PCGamer"/><ref name="GameGrin"/><ref name="RockPaperShotgun"/><ref name="Kotaku"/> VisualNovelist of [[Jeuxvideo.com]] positively compared the game's visual quality to ''[[Everlasting Summer]]'', another independent visual novel with the appearance of a professional production.<ref name="Jeuxvideo"/> Reviewers pointed out that the game's horror was built on the destruction of a sense of control over what happens in the game and the feeling of helplessness that stems from the distortions in the game's world.<ref name="RockPaperShotgun"/><ref name="Polygon1"/> Victoria Rose of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' stated that this approach was strikingly different from traditional horror games and films, where the viewer remains alienated from what is happening on the screen.<ref name="Polygon1"/> Amy Josuweit of ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'' noted that while earlier visual novels have broken the fourth wall by crashing the client or adding extra files, ''Doki Doki Literature Club!'' changed the angle by deliberately destroying files rather than adding them.<ref name="RockPaperShotgun"/>

''[[GQ]]''{{'}}s Tom Philip commented that at times the narrative felt like "a slog, clicking through endless amounts of inane, flirty conversation about poetry."<ref name=gq>{{cite magazine |title=''Doki Doki Literature Club'' Is the Most Messed Up Horror Game You'll Play This Year |last=Philip |first=Tom |url=https://www.gq.com/story/doki-doki-literature-club-is-the-most-messed-up-horror-game-youll-play-this-year |magazine=[[GQ]] |date=October 19, 2017 |accessdate=October 19, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612140233/https://www.gq.com/story/doki-doki-literature-club-is-the-most-messed-up-horror-game-youll-play-this-year |archive-date=June 12, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Fenner opined that the game did not pass the [[Bechdel test]] and positioned the protagonist as a seductive casanova. However, he emphasized that the plot is ultimately a "sharply aware polemic against harem anime/visual novels" in which "the lengths the ladies go to are not wholly because of the protagonist, but rather he can be read as a symptom—an easy outlet." Fenner also felt that the game, like ''[[Katawa Shoujo]]'' before it, "appears to veer dangerously close to fetishization of very real issues".<ref name="RPGFan"/> Nevertheless, reviewers recognized the game's plot focus as successful and relevant.<ref name="RPGFan"/><ref name="PCGamer"/><ref name="GameGrin"/>
