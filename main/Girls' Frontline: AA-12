'''AA12''' is a character from the Tactical SRPG ES game '''[[Girls' Frontline]]''' developed by MicaTeam and published by Digital Sky and its derivatives. She joined the struggle on June 21, 2018.

== Historical basis ==

The weapon originated from an experimental project by Max Atchisson, the AAS, which was field-tested in Vietnam, exhibiting effectivness in close-quarters combat in the jungles. The AAS was automatic, which increased its firepower potential. After the war ended, a number of improved weapon systems based on the AAS were worked on. The AA-12 emerged as a modernized AAS in the 1980s, and was improved over the next 20 years without going into serial production. Military Police Systems of the USA acquired the rights of the AA-12 in the 2000s in hopes that it would be used by the US police forces and the US military. The South Korean USAS-12 also originated from the Atchisson concept of automatic shotguns.

The AAS is chambered for the 12 Gauge shells which are powerful enough yet comfortably enough to fire, at the same time due to the wide availability of shells of this caliber, this decision also lowered production and usage costs. The AAS uses a simple blowback, open-bolt mechanism to fire in full-auto. The cylindrical bolt is positioned inside the steel chamber. To house the long bolt when it reciprocates back and to lower the rate of fire the entire mechanism extends all the way back to the butt stock. The firing mechanism was borrowed from the Browning M1918, while the handguard was borrowed from the M16A1. 

The MPS-developed AA-12 has 188 changes and improvements to the original blueprint, modifications included changing the AA-12 from blowback- to gas-operated with a locked breech. "When the bolt flies back after firing to cycle another round, around 80% of what would normally be felt as recoil is absorbed by a proprietary gas system. A recoil spring grabs another 10%, leaving the final recoil a remarkable 10% of the normal recoil for a 12-gauge round—so you can point the AA-12 at a target and unload the full magazine without significant loss of accuracy". MPS also teamed up with Action Manufacturing Company, and Special Cartridge Company to combine the gun with FRAG-12 High-Explosive ammunition into a multifunction weapon system.
The weapon was lightened to 4.76 kg (10.5 lb) and shortened to 966 mm (38.0 in) but retained the same barrel length. The CQB model has a 13-inch barrel, and is half a pound lighter than the regular model. Uncommon in other automatic shotguns, the AA-12 fires from an open bolt, a feature more commonly found in submachine guns, as well as heavy and squad-level machine guns. It uses 8-round box, 20-round drum, or 32-round drum magazines, as opposed to the original 5-round box magazine. Due to the abundant use of stainless steel and the fouling-resistant design, MPS has claimed that the weapon requires little to no cleaning or lubrication. Its designer however states that cleaning is required after 10,000 rounds.

{{Cquote|<big>'''''A bit bad-tempered, often pushes herself into doing what she isn't good at before entering self-hatred, if sugar isn't taken in in time she becomes prone to feel ill. Likes staying up late into the night to listen to deep-night radio stations, especially the emotion-related "Kalina's confession office". Abhors brutal violence, but using guns doesn't fall inside this category. She thinks that weapons are but a civilized, effective solution.'' (脾气稍微有点臭，常常勉强自己做不擅长的事然后又陷入自我厌恶，如果不及时摄取糖分的话就容易犯恶心。晚上喜欢熬夜听深夜电台，特别是情感类的「格林娜的倾述办公室」。非常讨厌野蛮的暴力，不过用枪并不在这个范畴里，她认为武器只是一种文明有效的解决手段。)'''''</big>

*Hyperketonemia describes an elevated level of '''ketone bodies''' in the blood, usually as a result of the body breaking down fat instead of glucose (due to a shortage of the latter) to provide energy required to sustain life.

*It is also commonly generalized with '''ketosis''', the metabolic state in which the liver breaks down fatty acids to produce ketone bodies. Normally, ketone concentrations in the human blood resides below 0.2 mmol/L, with post-exercise levels between 2.5 and 3.5 mmol/L. However, if other complications (such as type 1 diabetes) are present, the levels may exceed 15 mmol/L if left unchecked, evoking '''ketoacidosis''', which is a life-threatening emergency.

*This is also in agreement with the setting that AA-12 requires punctual intakes of sugar.
