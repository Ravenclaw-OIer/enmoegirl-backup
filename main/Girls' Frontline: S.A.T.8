'''S.A.T.8''' is a character from the Tactical SRPG ES game '''[[Girls' Frontline]]''' and its derivatives developed by MicaTeam and published by Digital Sky. She joined the fray on September 22, 2017.

== Historical basis ==
When it comes to the S.A.T.8 (short for Semi-Automatic Tactical, 8 shots) series of weapons, there surfaces the need to introduce a persistent dream of developing a shotgun of H&K.

In the 1980s, HK-USA (the US subsidiary of H&K) started a merger with Benelli, selling large numbers of the MP5 series of SMGs and Benelli shotguns to the US markets (such as the M1014 adopted by the US armed forces). However, the joint venture did not progress further without any joint development of a new shotgun. After more than 10 years as one, Benelli broke free from HK in 1996, resulting in the absence of a favourable shotgun in H&K's product list (The CAWS proposed by H&K in 1982 was turned down in favour of the ACR project). Still in 1996, H&K formed cooperative relationships with Italian shotgun manufacturer FABARM, and a new family of shotguns were introduced two years later as the result of the joint venture-the HK FABARM FP-6 series, while the S.A.T.8 is one variant of the FP-6 series.

The FABARM company was not a famed company at first. Before its cooperation with HK, it manufactured traditional sporting/hunting shotguns, such as the BIG GAME series, while the FP-6 was positioned as a pump combat shotgun, with pronounced features for military/police use. The FP-6 and the S.A.T.8 are both listed under the "law enforcement" tab on the official site of FABARM, making S.A.T.8, a semi-automatic variant of the FP-6 with an enlarged magazine a whopper combat weapon.

In the introduction picture, the S.A.T.8 "is like" an improved variant of the FAST-20, but actually the S.A.T.8 was ''made'' to replace the "semi-automatic" shotguns made by slightly modifying the bolt of the FP-6, such as the FAST-20/-14. (note that the figures in the names "FAST-20" and "FAST-14" refer to the barrel length in inches.) Due to how the FAST-20 is equipped with a FABARM in-house "automatic magazine" feed system, users have to mount a special tube magazine with a capacity of 8 rounds to enable the semi-automatic function of the FAST-20, while the weapon is essentially an FP-6 with a charging handlke mounted by the extraction port without the long magazine, which, when compared to the Benelli M3 or the even older SPAS-12, makes this kind of semi-pump transition rather complex. Though the design lowered the production cost when simultaneously manufacturing semi-auto and pump-action shotguns, it also made the FAST-20 bear an uncertain position in the market (civilian pump-action/military police semi-auto), with the risk of illegal but easy conversion to a semi-automatic shotgun. The FAST-20 was soon replaced by the semi-auto-only S.A.T.8. The handguard of the S.A.T.8 looks identical to that of the FP-6, but it is fixed in place and the weapon is capable of semi-automatic fire only.

As a shotgun developed with H&K personnel, the FP-6 and its variants indeed surpassed some traditional shotguns in some aspects. As a tactical weapon, the S.A.T. 8 is built from lightweight ERGAL 55 alloy (for its receiver) and ABS plastic (for the handguard), and both parts have the MIL-STD-1913 tactical rail system installed, capable of accepting any and all optics and accessories compatible with the system. A set of ghost-ring iron sights is also provided. Some of the S.A.T.8's equipped with a heat-dissipating barrel shroud when sold. The FP-6 used the "Tribore barrel" developed by HK, divided into three parts with different bore diameters. The first part is cone-shaped, spanning a length of 10 cm, with an internal diameter of 25mm graduating to 18.8mm, capable of mitigating recoil felt at the moment of fire. The second part is a quasi-cylindrical barrel 35 cm long, its bore diameter starting from 18.8mm to 18.4mm, which raises the muzzle velocity of the rounds. The final part includes an integrated cylindrical 3/4 choker specifications may differ due to different models), to improve shot spread (the average spread of a 60-round group of lead slugs is 5.04 cm, which is highly competitive among shotguns of the same type and caliber. A breaching muzzle is provided on virtually all the S.A.T.8's capable of breaching locks. It can also be detached and replaced by at least 5 different models of muzzle devices. The stock of the S.A.T.8 has a rubber recoil-dampening pad to make firing comfortable. The trigger force is non-adjustable and the weapon lacks a short-barrel variant (while there are short-barrels among the FP-6 family and its pump-action variants, such as the MARTIAL series of the STF-12 family).

The SAT-8 uses 23/4 inch or 3-inch 12 Gauge shells, using a patented semi-automatic shotgun gas-operated automation mechanism developed by HK Fabarm(an improved short-stroke piston system). The highlights of the system lies in a polymer compression ring around the tube-shaped magazine, positioned between the handguard and the piston. The ring is compressed by pressure when a round is fired, making it travel at a constant speed backwards regardless of the type of ammunition. The larger the barrel pressure, the higher the friction between the ring and the outside of the magazine, and therefore higher friction is applied to the entire automation system. This effectively controlled the backflow of gas, prevents too-high pressures from building up while making the entire automation cycle more controllable, smooth and reliable (it is worth noting that the automation of the mechanism is beneficial to bolt reliability if controlled within a certain velocity margin. Making it too fast or too slow risks jams or cessation of feeding), and makes the weapon adaptive towards different types of ammunition.

The SAT-8 has three variants so far, one using a fixed stock and a semi-grip, called the SAT-8 Tactical, one with a fixed stock and a pistol grip, called the SAT-5 Pro Forces, and the other using a telescopic stock, called the S.A.T.8 PRO TELESCOPIC. Judging from the illustrations, the character wields an S.A.T.8 PRO TELESCOPIC shotgun.

Her illustrator NIN released the picture of S.A.T.8's overall appearance and equipment in their entireties on February 14, 2018, accompanied by large amounts of text to describe <del>boast her own daughter.</del> (The following (translated) content is entirely original, from the illustrator herself <del>and includes mistakes xD</del>)

{{Cquote|''Immediately thought about the romantic sense of Italy when I took the commission for S.A.T.8. Just want to draw an open-minded enthusiastic kid kept thinking about it over and over, and added a lot of elements that I personally thought are energetic and romantic. That's it. In short, it suits me well. It'll be best if everyone can like this kid. <br>

The clothing takes inspiration from some grocery stores and gas stations' work garments. The Italian ribbon surrounded by Vatican orange. Thought that there's a sense of romance this way. Never forgot about protecting her sports shorts when wearing girlish skirts, with well-placed defenses. Coupled with the sneakers and short socks, full of energy. The white color up her chest and the gloves are magic stickers. The smoothly-outlined shield won't keep people at a distance.<br>

The socks and the orange shield and the octaple teeth are hints about the Fabarm-exclusive compensator and the two exclusive chokes. The "lion" nickname also has links to the logo of its manufactures. Finally a bit of dark color to keep the atmosphere low.<br><nowiki>*</nowiki>Inside the bright energetic clothes are steady dark-colored garments.''

 ({{lang|0404|接到S.A.T.8稿子的時候立即想到的是意大利的浪漫風<br>情，好想畫一個開朗又熱情的孩子阿這樣反覆思考著<br>然後把很多個人認為有活力和浪漫的元素都加進去了。<br>就是這樣。一言敝之就是很對我自己的口味，如果大家<br>也能喜歡上這個孩子的話就太好了。<br>

服裝的剪裁來自於一些便利店和油站的工作服設計，意大<br>利的結領被梵諦岡色彩的橙黃色包圍著，總覺得這樣畫有<br>一種浪漫的感覺，穿著少女氣息的短裙同時也沒有忘記好<br>好保護自己的<del>光之美少女一樣</del>的運動短褲，防禦非常到位，<br>配上運動鞋和短襪，滿滿的生命力。胸口和手套的白色<br>部份是魔術貼。外型順滑的護盾不會讓人覺得難以接近。<br>

襪子和護盾的橙色還有八重齒都是為了暗示Fabarm公司<br>的專屬槍口補償器和兩種特殊槍喉，獅子的暱稱也跟生<br>產商的LOGO有著關係，最後再加一點深色讓氣氛不要<br>太高漲吧。<br><nowiki>*</nowiki>鮮艷活潑的裡面是沉穩的深色系。)}}

{{Cquote|''S.A.T.8 is a born gentle and cautious kid, but being simply so is just too boring. Before becoming a T-doll, she's an A-doll dedicated to fill gaps on different posts, from selling cookies on the streets to grocery stores to high-end hotels, feeders, kindergartens to personal baby-sitters, a true workaholic. Came to Grifon to report in with all the understandings of life and talking skills learned from various posts.<br>

The design of the T-doll is somehow connected with her own past and the history of her gun. The thick, naturally-curled golden hair looks gentle, and adjusts the curls according to humidity in the air, with a gentle smile and squinty eyes, makes people think twice about what she says. Thinks before she says, though a play-girl in ordinary circumstances, she retreats the moment the bottom line is exceeded. A dog person actually.<br>

Has no prejudices in love, won't dislike entirely even if the commander's homosexual or having other weird hobbies. Though not so high in her height, she does have a big-sister-esque personality. The chest often pressed by body-tight underwear actually has something.<br><nowiki>*</nowiki>Specialty: Her hair gets more messy as she tries to comb it.''

===Pan===
The pan-shaped structure at waist level depicted in the illustration is not a 3-wheel wall ascender, nor a reflecting magnetic drum, and is never that pan in [[PUBG]].

Referring illustrator NIN's words, "''Wanted to design a pan-like shield to enhance her cooking skills, and there's PUBG a few months later all out of a sudden. So embarrassing. Actually a vectorable, detachable shield supported by three hydraulics.'' (那個時侯是想設計一個像平底鍋的盾加強一下廚藝力, 幾個月之後吃雞突然出現了, 真尬, 實際上是一個由3條液壓支撐的可轉向可分離盾牌。)"

{{Hide|Title=Explanation about the "pan"|Text=[[File:S.A.T_锅.png|center|thumb|400px|<center>Weibo:@NIN_LION <ref>http://weibo.com/5835967453/FmHNVjbn8?filter=hot&root_comment_id=0&type=comment#_rnd1505916682403 weibo:@NIN_LION</ref></center>]]}}

===Domesticity===

SAT8 excels in Italian food, especially pizza, as seen in her adjutant lines, {{spoiler|which is in stark contrast to [[Girls' Frontline: SPAS-12|a certain Italian friend who only knows to eat]].}}

At the same time she loves small animals, her big-sister figure expressing her gentle personality, probably able to capture quite a handful of commanders'hearts. {{Spoiler|That is, if they can get her.}}
{{Hide|Title=Spring Festival of 2018, mail on Day 4|Text=

'''''It's Day 4, commander, still got some new-year supplies'''''

''Commander, the Spring Festival is already halfway over, but the happy atmosphere of everyone isn't even declining. I'm handling the remaining supplies, but it's more than I thought. If commander doesn't mind, please help take some.
Btw, many Italian restaurants are closed on the streets now right? I'm not closing here. If you are sick of rice cakes, come to my dorm to have a pizza party!''

('''初四啦，指挥官，这里还有年货'''

指挥官，新春已经过半了，不过大家热闹的氛围依然还没有衰减呢。我正在处理剩余的年货，但比我想象中的还要多呢，指挥官不介意的话就请帮我收下一些吧。
对了，街上很多意式餐厅已经休业了吧？我这里可不打烊哦，要是吃腻了年糕的话，就来我的宿舍开披萨派对吧！)
