'''''My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic''''' ( Japanese : マイリトルポニー〜トモダチは魔法〜 , Chinese : 彩虹小马：友谊是魔法/小马宝莉：友谊的魔力 ) is an animated series based on [[Hasbro]]'s popular My Little Pony franchise. The show premiered on October 10, 2010 on Hasbro's The Hub channel, now known as [[Discovery Family]] as of October 13, 2014. It ended after nine seasons on October 12, 2019. This incarnation of the franchise is referred to as the fourth generation, or G4, of My Little Pony. The show was developed for television by [[Lauren Faust]], who is known for her work on two of Cartoon Network's popular and critically-acclaimed franchises, namely [[The Powerpuff Girls]] and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends.

The series stars a unicorn pony named [[Twilight Sparkle]], a student of [[Princess Celestia]], the ruler of the magical land of [[Equestria]]. The princess gives Twilight the task of learning about friendship and sends her and her assistant, a baby dragon named [[Spike]], to Ponyville. There, they meet some interesting ponies, including action-loving [[Rainbow Dash]], glamorous [[Rarity]], hard-working [[Applejack]], timid [[Fluttershy]], and hyperactive [[Pinkie Pie]]. Together, they go on adventures, solve various problems, and learn about the magic of friendship.
