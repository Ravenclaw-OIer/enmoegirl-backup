'''''Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club''''' ({{lang|ja|ラブライブ！虹ヶ咲学園スクールアイドル同好会 }}) is a new project of ''[[Love Live! Series]]'' starting from 2017, which is set in the Nijigasaki High School in Odaiba, Tokyo, where 9 girls are gathered and form their own school idol unit called Nijigasaki High School Idol Club. 

== Introduction ==
Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club is a project of a school idol group, which would appear in the mobile game [[LoveLive! School Idol Festival ALL STARS]].

Unlike [[μ's]] and [[Aqours]], the members in this group are solo idols. They are rivals instead of teammates. Every month, there would be a monthly ranking activity, where members compete with each other.

== History ==
=== The announcement of PDP ===
At the SIF Thanksgiving Festival 2016, [[Aqours]] announced a new project of SIF.

On 30 March 2017, which is the 4th anniversary of SIF, the project ''LoveLive! School idol festival PERFECT Dream Project'' (PDP) is announced, which would include a new group of school idols. After that, the 9 members of the new group are gradually revealed. The 9 members of the new group are divided into three groups, and each group is assigned to a game media platform. On 12 June 2017, the members started their activities on their respective game media platform.

On 21 September, the details of PDP are released. A new mobile game [[LoveLive! School Idol Festival ALL STARS]] would be released. In the game, [[μ's]], [[Aqours]], and the new group of school idols would be included. The name of the group ''Nijigasaki High School Idol Club'' (Nijigaku) and the casts are released.

=== The start of Nijigaku's activity ===
After the release of the details, the casts of Nijigaku also started their activities. As they are a group of school idols under the mobile game LLAS, their activity mainly focused on games, such as gaming videos on their respective game media platforms, programmes on the gaming channel AbemaTV Ultra Games.

Also, on their first livestream, their first album was announced. After a year, on 21 November 2018, their first album ''[[TOKIMEKI Runners]]'' is released. 

After 2018, there are several changes on their activities. First, their activities on game media platforms is ended. Instead, they are reformed into three sub-units ([[DiverDiva]], [[A·ZU·NA]] and [[QU4RTZ]]). Also, their monthly livestream is started.

On 2 October 2019, their second album ''[[Love U my friends]]'' is released.

=== The announcement of the TV anime series ===
Nijigaku was started as a group of school idols under a mobile game only. They were not an idol project under Love Live! Series, and they were not planned to have their own TV anime seires at first. Yet, after two years of activities, they have gained considerable popularity. Therefore, on Day2 of their first live ([[Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club First Live “with You”]]), their anime television series was announced. Also, there are several changes on their official site. First, a new logo with the name "LoveLive! School idol project" is used. Second, a new copyright name "©PROJECT Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club" is used. Also, the slogan on the site is changed from {{lang|ja|あなたと叶える新しい物語}} (the slogan of LLAS) to '''{{lang|ja|届け！ときめき——。}}'''. These changes indicates that Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club is no longer a side project under the game LLAS, but a proper idol project under Love Live! Series instead.

After the announcement of anime television series, as "You" (the player of LLAS) plays an important role in the plot of Nijigaku, it is announced that "You" will appear in the anime television series. "Your" image is revealed, and a voting for "Your" name is started.

== Nijigasaki High School Idol Club ==
*The group is usually named Nijigaku (ニジガク) in short.
*The members include the 9 solo idols and "You" (the player of LLAS).
*All of the school idols are solo idols. They only practise together in their classroom.
*The members are both friends and rivals.
