My windowsill does moon lie
No man in my sight, only I'm left behind
Stay up all the night, shuttle in poet time
{{Languageicon|German}} Peraventure ich, ich have ybeen, ybeen Li Bai<ref>[[enwiki:Li Bai|Li Bai]]: one of the most famous Chinese poets, acclaimed from his own day to the present as a genius and a romantic figure who took traditional poetic forms to new heights.</ref>

Moonlight shines aground, bowing down, who is drowned?
The milky way is long, pick a piece,make my chant
Why don’t you sing along, or you just want to be la la la la la
Nothing is wrong,what you want is yet to come
Dark has given us beams of light on the pond
Reflected on my chant, shining bright, go beyond
Late night poets catch up with my song, let us la la la la la
Just tonight, our minds brightly shine

Open my eyes, for the nights till it arrives
You told me to lie down, I told you, “Realize”
Goddess Nyx<ref>[[enwiki:Nyx|Nyx]]: the Greek goddess (or personification) of the night.</ref> blessed me with my sharp and pretty eyes
Pity you’ve gone for, your mind has deadly died

Moonlight shines aground, bowing down, who is drowned?
The milky way is long, pick a piece, make my chant
No matter up or down, please just make it with me la la la la la
Nothing is wrong, this is what, what we want
Dark has given us beams of light on the pond
Reflected on my chant, shining bright, go beyond
Late night poets catch up with my song, let us la la la la la
Just tonight, our minds brightly shine

May you sleeping people meet your Onirii<ref>[[enwiki:Oneiros|Onirii]]: the personification of dreams in Greek mythology. </ref>
Let us wear our earphones, have a fun time with Euterpe<ref>[[enwiki:Euterpe|Euterpe]]: one of the Muses in Greek mythology, presiding over music.</ref>
We still have some time by the shining sunrise
Make the chant only for this night

Moonlight shines aground, bowing down, who is drowned?
The milky way is long, pick a piece,make my chant
No matter up or down, please just make it with me la la la la la
Nothing is wrong, this is what, what we want
Dark has given us beams of light on the pond
Reflected on my chant, shining bright, go beyond
Late night poets catch up with my song, let us la la la la la
Just tonight, our minds brightly shine

Just tonight, our minds brightly shine
''(PV Text: Presented to all the night owls)''
