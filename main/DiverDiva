== Introduction ==
DiverDiva is a sub-unit under [[Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club]]. The unit consists of two members, [[Asaka Karin]] and [[Miyashita Ai]].

The name DiverDiva is combined with the words Diva and Diver, which symbolizes two divas who would dive deeply into your hearts. Also, Diver is pronounced similarly with Odaiba ({{lj|お台場}}), which is the place where Nijigasaki High School is located (Ai's favourite puns).

The unit is composed with two members with opposite characteristics. Ai is bright and friendly like the Sun, while Karin is cool and sexy like the Moon. Therefore, when the two girls perform together, their difference in performance styles makes good chemistry. This creates the unique performance style of DiverDiva which is both passionate and sexy.
