Koakuma ({{lj|小悪魔}}) is a devil where she's seen around the library of [[Scarlet Devil Mansion]] where she apparently lives in the mansion. Her exact role is difficult to tell, but she is believed to be an assistant in [[Patchouli Knowledge]]'s library. She was the fourth stage midboss of [[Embodiment of Scarlet Devil]] and little is known about her, and unless she makes another appearance, she remains a mystery.
