'''Ribeyrolles''' is a character from the Tactical SRPG ES game '''Girls' Frontline''' and its derivatives developed by MicaTeam and published by Digital Sky. She was introduced on 4 May, 2017.

== Historical basis ==

'''Ribeyrolles''' was developed as an automatic carbine/light machine gun/assault rifle by Gladiator of France. This infantry weapon fires a specially-developed 8mm Ribeyrolles round, which is probably the first intermediate cartridge developed specifically for assault rifles. It is yielded by necking down a .351 Winchester casing and fitting an 8mm (0.31 in) Ribeyrolle AP round. This weapon system was developed by Ribeyrolles, one of the designers of the Mle 1915 light machinegun. It underwent trials at the Versailles testing grounds on 6 July, 1918, and a full trial took place at Camp de Chalons from 20 July, 1912 to 18 August. However, the results were not satisfying. The action mechanism was unreliable and was plagued with stoppages, and the ballistic performance of its cartridge did not meet expectations, with accuracy experiencing a severe drop beyond 400 meters. It was too heavy as an infantry weapon, while not accurate and long-ranged enough for a light machinegun, putting this weapon in a stall.

In fact, the idea of having intermediate cartridges were very advanced at that time, albeit appearing 20 years earlier. The primary idea of the military in the WWI-era was still to pursue the long-range effectiveness of rifles, causing military experts at that time to be unable to accept a weapon capable of providing heavy firepower at only 400 meters.

The Ribeyrolles automatic carbine has a wooden semi-grip-functioning stock. The metal parts were produced from steel, with a metal lid at the end of the cylindrical receiver. The front of the receiver houses the barrel, with the cocking handle and the extraction port on the right side of the receiver. The bolt consists of a small-diameter return spring on a guiding rod mounted on a shaft. As with the layout of rifles of that time, a wooden upper handguard is placed on the upper part of the barrel, and is secured to the lower handguard by the protective barrel shroud. These parts are directly borrowed from the Mle 1916 rifle. A wire bipod is mounted on the front shround, and is folded to below the lower handguard when not in use. A rotating selector is mounted to the right of the stock, above the trigger, with the front position allowing automatic fire, the back allowing semi-automatic position, and the middle position engaging the safety. A front-blade rear-notch iron sight is provided, with calibrations from 200 meters to 2000 meters at 200-meter increments. It is fed by a 25-round curved box magazine. It utilizes a direct-blowback system. The firing pin is independently driven by a cam, and fires from a closed bolt. It is compatible with the French M1886-15 or M1915 bayonet. Some features of this weapon (such as the receiver) was later used on the experimental 9mm-caliber STA1924 sub-machinegun.

===Weapon trivia===

Though the Federov Avtomat appeared earlier than the Ribeyrolles automatic carbine, the 6.5mmSR Arisaka cartridge fired by the Federov M1916 was not deemed as an intermediate cartridge, therefore prompting western military experts to widely recognize the Ribeyrolles automatic carbine as the first assault rifle of the world.

===The first {{ruby|concept|invalid}} assault rifle===

The official blog[http://weibo.com/shaonvqianxian?refer_flag=0000015010_&from=feed&loc=nickname&is_all=1#1493375839547 @少女前线]describes '''Ribeyrolles''' as '''[http://weibo.com/5611537367/F0EcQj3qf?filter=hot&root_comment_id=0&type=comment#_rnd1493375846003  the first concept assault rifle]'''.

The debate regarding the earliest assault rifle never ceased, and is not subject to determination here.

But as the concept, experimental assault rifle from the early years of the last century, problems do exist.

As with her '''{{ruby|Franco-Prussian War-era|outdated}}''' French military-like outfit, the blood bag and [[bandage]] accompanying her and her sleepy look, the bad luck of getting injured on unlikely occasions, and the fact that she falls even when winning a battle, she seems very unreliable.

{{Spoiler|The [[Girls' Frontline: G11|G11]] next door still wakes up when she gets damaged, while Ribeyrolles seems unreliable head-to-toe, in a complete state of irreversibility.}}

But still, Ribeyrolles was indeed unreliable during the tests, with frequent stoppages.

However, she seems to escape death all the time even with her bad luck of getting hurt in unlikely scenarios. Is this her luck, or her bad luck???

=== Personality ===
Ribeyrolles' illustrator rei made the first direct reply addressing the requests for the personality of Ribeyrolles on 26 August, 2017.

{{Cquote|
''As an answer to the need for Ribeyrolles' personality on ask.''

''Her clothes is a crude modification based off a patient's clothes (so there should be nothing worn inside <nowiki>[x]</nowiki>(She did wear her pantsu). The fabric is connected below her torso, disqualifying her clothes as a <nowiki>[dress]</nowiki>. The wide bands in front of her chest can be detached (as per the picture), so are all tube-type attachments and bandages (according to medical needs).''

''A typical loli. Barefoot, or it should be said that she didn't have her own shoes at all. A gun that has ceased <nowiki>(production)</nowiki> in the future. Due to numerous defects found in the weapon's design, most of her time in her memory is spent in the infirmary, with few chances of being called to the battlefield.''

''If G11 spends most of the time sleeping, then Ribeyrolles spends most of the time in a coma. She's barely awake throughout the day, and when she's awake she basically worries whether she will pass out the next second.''

''Has strong doubts and even disdain of her own existence deep inside. The psychology of Ribeyrolles should be considered twisted. Defects in her chip and her system are numerous, therefore she didn't have an <nowiki>[intact]</nowiki> personality, plus that she has few contacts with the outside world, leaving her next to no chances to study. Judging from the psychology blueprint, she should have high levels of dignity with her own goals. But her numerous defeats caused her to fall into confusion about her own position, seen from the outside as a not-so-confident T-doll who cannot become confident.''

''Due to numerous defects, Ribeyrolles should not have so-called friends, costing her full strength to just earn the affection from the commander. She can get some scents of <nowiki>[companionship]</nowiki> from G11, but the chances of getting hope from this is extremely bleak.''

''Dreamt about the day when she receives a design improvement, going to the battlefield with a normal uniform as a normal T-doll.''

(应ask上关于利贝罗勒小设定的需求。

关于衣服设定，是以病号服为基础的魔改（所以里面按理说应该什么也不穿【x】（还是有穿内裤的）。裆部下面是连着的，因此不能算作是【裙子】。胸前白色的宽带可卸（如图），所有的线类配件和绷带都（根据病情需要）可卸。

典型的萝莉体。光脚，或者说根本就没有自己的鞋子。未来已经停止的一把枪。因为枪械设计问题太多，记忆中大部分时间都在病房里，被叫去上战场的机会极少。

如果G11大部分时间都是在睡觉，那么利贝罗勒大部分时间就是在昏迷状态。一天当中清醒的时间极少，而清醒的时间基本都用来担心自己会不会下一秒又昏迷过去。

内心深处对自己的存在抱有强烈的疑惑甚至厌恶感，利贝罗勒的性格应该算是扭曲的。芯片和系统上的缺陷极多，并没有给予她一个【完善】的人格，再加上与外界接触极少，学习的机会也所剩无几。按照人格蓝图的数据来看，应该是一个自尊心比较高、有自我追求的人格框架。但屡屡失败的战果让她对自己的人格定位感到迷茫。对外来看就是一把不怎么自信、也无法变得自信的人形。

因为各种方面的缺失，利贝罗勒应该没有所谓的朋友，就连获取指挥官的好感这件事都要用尽全力。她最多可以从G11身上获得一些【同类】的气息，但从此获得希望曙光的几率极小。

梦想是希望有一天能得到设计上的改良，能够像一个正常的人形一样、穿着正常的制服，上战场吧。)

Her creator (mother) has thoroughly explained her personality: Psychologically twisted with self-hatred. Unconfident, and dire for attention. Therefore, it can be seen that Ribeyrolles is one of the few illustrator-designated T-dolls with a full load of negative emotions.

But per her performance in the game, Ribeyrolles did ''not'' suffer numerous defeats: Having an ''AR-effective set of tiles as an AR herself'', with a supportive skill oriented around bursts of output which favor ARs, she basically boosts the output of any and all ARs standing on her effective tiles to a horrifying level. Herself being an AR, though not the spine of the entire team in terms of firepower, she became the preferential choice {{Spoiler|whose firepower is at least better than an HG}} in the stead of an HG whose damage is not so high but could also support her team.

Some other trivia can be known from her creator's words, <del>such as the fact that Ribeyrolles' didn't wear anything below her clothes (smile).</del> Also the bands mentioned refers to the crossed wide white bands in her illustration, while the ''(as per the picture)'' is the profile image of this page. As it is from the same creator, her look could be compared with the illustration in-game.

In addition, a very short-but-brutal post was posted by her illustrator at 11:48 AM, 11 October, 2017 which read as: "'''Who provided Ribeyrolles' clothes: She modified it herself. (利贝罗勒的衣服是谁提供的：她自己改的 ​​​)'''<ref>http://weibo.com/1741550804/FpRjqxccU?type=repost</ref>”. Hinting that Ribeyrolles has an expertise in handcrafting.
