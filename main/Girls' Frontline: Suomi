=== Design ===

The Suomi M1931 uses a traditional open-bolt simple blowback action commonly found on contemporary submachine guns. Designers made some necessary improvements to the M/26, around 100 of which was produced back in 1925-1926. Redundant space in front of the bolt was removed, clearing the possibility of a ham occurring when a round is chambered. The muzzle end of the barrel shroud was slanted to mitigate vertical recoil, with a simpler and more reliable design. The barrel can be quickly detached and replaced, while the cartridge chambered for was changed from the 7.65x21mm to the 9mm Parabellum. The KP/-31 has numerous feed systems, with the earliest 20-round magazines and 40-round drums being used during the 1930s to 1940, and were used as backup devices during WWII. The 70-round drum and the 50-round magazine are mainly used during WWII, with the former being the most reliable feed system of the KP/-31, while the 50-round magazine, designed by Swedish personnel, was unreliable due to its complexity, suffering from jams should dust enter, and was abandoned in Autumn, 1943. The 36-round magazine was designed by Swedish personnel in the 1950s, and was as reliable as the 70-round drum and was lighter.

The Suomi KP/-31 entered serial production at Tikkakoski Oy in 1931, most of which were supplied to the Finnish Defence Forces. However, not many were ordered, with only 375 units delivered by the end of 1934. The number rose to no more than 4000 at the start of the Winter War. The KP/-31 suffered from a few problems during the war, including perceptible vertical recoil despite the weapon's design limiting it. Another problem of barrel wear was found in January, 1940. This issue was deemed the result of dust and snow entering the barrel from the muzzle, prompting the installation of a muzzle device on the KP/-31, adding another 55 millimeters to its length, with the overall weight reaching 4.9kg. This variant was called the KP/-31 SJR, where SJR stood for ‘’suujarru’’, or “muzzle device”. However, Aimo Lahti opposed this modification, deeming that the original design had sufficed in countering muzzle rise, and that the recoil from a submachinegun itself was not heavy enough to produce substantial consequences, in addition to the muzzle device lowering the muzzle velocity of its cartridges, affecting ballistic performance.  <ref>In fact, the KP/-31’s ballistic performance was never better than the PPSh and the PPS, whose muzzle velocity approached 500 m/s, while inferior to the MAB38 and the MAB38A which fired M38 Fiocchi rounds at 450 m/s. </ref>. Aside from that, the muzzle device was not reliable in the cold weather, causing gunpowder residue to accumulate inside before flowing into the receiver, sticking onto the bolt causing misfires. The barrel wear issue was actually caused by moisture of the cartridges. Starting from 1942, all KP/-31 submachine guns ordered by the Finnish Defence Forces are equipped with muzzle devices, eventually having half of the M1931 submachine guns in service within the military being the SJR variant. The Suomi KP/-31 was initially meant for replacing light machineguns, with a few being equipped with bipods and foregrips for the role, but the attempt was a failure. To the time of the Continuation War, an ordinary Finnish infantry squad was equipped with a KP/-31 and a light-machine gun (usually a captured DP), with an additional KP/-31 in 1943 provided to each squad. A third KP/-31 was planned, but the plan was abandoned as the war ended.

{{Cquote|
''Due to the KP-31 having a deep connection with the Winter War (1939-1940), I viewed a lot of related data before I started.

Gave Suomi-chan a white coat according to the white cloaks Finnish soldiers had worn then, as well as to give a fluffy texture as found on rabbits and bears in the winter forest. Wanted to have a girl who can represent the winter days.

Wanted to draw black thigh-highs initially, but changed it to white ones as advised by Phantania-san.

Really happy to be able to make illustrations for Girls' Frontline!''

(因为KP-31和冬季作战（苏芬战争1939~1940）有很深的关系，所以在作画开始前看了非常多关于冬季作战的相关资料。

在作画时根据当时芬兰军人所穿的白色斗篷，以及为了表现出冬季山林间的兔子和熊那样毛茸茸的质感，于是给索米酱穿上了白色的上衣。想要画出能再现这样冬日光景的少女。

最开始是想画成黑色过膝袜的，在担当Phantania桑的建议下改成了白色的。

能够一直为少女前线制作立绘感到非常开心！)

Her Illustrator Anmi mentioned white cloaks worn by Finnish soldiers then, but technically Finnish soldiers do ''not'' have white ''cloaks'', but rather the snowland camouflage uniforms.

This kind of camouflaged uniform is hand-modified from bed sheets, and is one of the iconic clothings of Finnish patrols, while the all-white winter camouflage made up of a hooded top and trousers cover the woolen hat, fur coats and Lapland-style boots worn by Finnish snipers.

==== Heavy Metal ====

Even wanting to play heavy metal music when oath links are established.

So practice caution when Suomi asks: ''Commander, are you tired? Want me to play some music?''

==== Soviet bears are the worst ====
Takes inspiration from the Winter War.

She hates all USSR-related articles, which inevitably includes T-dolls wielding Soviet firearms, and was angry to that she visually shivers when she was mistaken for [[Girls' Frontline: PPSh-41|Papasha]] when she first reported in.

Though to most commanders who don't actually have too much military knowledge, the Papasha and the Suomi were indeed quite close to each other, with rumors stating that most of the designs of the PPSh-41 was taken from the Suomi. But in fact, in terms of structural design, the only ''possible'' source of inspiration is the drum magazine, <del>which is still the least reliable part of the entire weapon, before being replaced with a Soviet magazine on the [[Girls' Frontline: PPS-43|PPS-43]].</del>

And regarding Soviet bears, Suomi probably has another special friend. {{Spoiler|The Mosin Nagant M1891 equipped with her exclusive chip, refer to [[Girls' Frontline: Mosin Nagant|Mosin Nagant]].}}

''"Yo, Comrade Papasha? Coming to take the stuff left at yesterday's welcoming party?"''

''Karina at the bar took a glance at the girl coming in from the door dressed in white.''

''……''

''However, the girl only replied with silence.''

''"What's up? Comrade Papasha?"''

''"Don't......."''

''"Hmm?"''

''Kalina turned around, only then did this foolish bartender pay attention to this lovely girl.''

''And her body shivering out of agony and the stagnating smile.''

''"Don't take me as one of those nasty Russkis!"''

''KP31, who had only just arrived at the command center was very unhappy.''

''Yes, verym unhappy.''

''The first person she met here just mixed her up with those contemptible Slavic girls, let alone the commander who had promised to come pick her up but instead left her alone in the bus station for half an hour.''

''Yes, KP31 was indeed very upset.''

''"Sorry! Forgive me this time."''

''"Humph!" Though KP31 still pretended as if still angry about it, it was obvious that she couldn't actually get angry with the idiot in front of her. "I won't let you go next time."''

''"Drinks on me this time~"''

''"Small-sized berry juice."''

''"OK! Just a second~" Kalina turned away to grab this very bottle of drink favoured by northern people.''

''Northern people from Scandinavia all the way to Caucasus, before they had vodka, used to make alcoholic drinks out of this kind of juice, out of climate reasons.''

''"Now habits and likings are basically the same." Kalina whispers to herself.''

''"What is it?" The voice of that girl behind her made her realize that she was just about to say something that would guarantee agonizing that kid again.''

''"Ah-ah, it's nothing." Kalina switched topics the moment she handed over the juice. "Speaking of which, KP31 just arrived at the command center today eh?"''

''"Yeah, the commander had told me that he would pick me up at the bus station, but instead left me alone. Humph."''

''"Ahahaha, we had a party stretching into late night, perhaps our commander should be still resting now, ahahahaha."''

''Of course, the fact is that 9A-91's welcoming party ended out of a sudden due to unexpected issues, with the remaining alcoholic drinks entirely consumed by that drunkard PK who also made the commander drink himself into unconsciousness.... Just keep those from her.''

''By the way, those drunk girls attended the morning exercise as if nothing had ever happened. It makes people wonder what exactly are Russian stomachs made up of.''

''"Humph, that's it. Should have at least '''someone''' come pick me up! Took me long enough to find my way here."''

''"Ahahaha, indeed. Don't know who's in charge of this." Of course, Kalina herself, who had been tasked with this matter did not get up in time. Just keep this matter which had only just came into mind away from her as well.''

''So just switch topics.''

''"By the way, what does KP31 like? You should be the first person from Finland. I'll see if I can get you something from Logistics."''

''"Ummm, then just give me some Surstromming"''

''"Ehh!?"''

''"Pfft, just a joke. I'm not taking too much of that myself."''

''"Phew, thought you were serious." If this Finnish girl actually opened one in the canteen, it could literally spell disaster.''

''"Now mind your manners. All you southern people know is to make fun of our traditional food. Alkali-processed fish was actually quite delicious." Seeing how Kalina was relieved, KP again showed upset.''

''"Aleh??" If remembered right that alkali-processed fish was made from actual caustic soda, is it really fine?''

''"But still, does Ms. Kalina like music?"''

''"Finnish ones? Heard of them before, some folksongs are actually quite nice."''

''"I brought CDs here today, come and hear it."''

''"OK!" Kalina seemed to be excited, as Finnish music often receive critical acclaim.''

''5 minutes later''

''"Ms. KP31?"''

''"What is it, Ms. Kalina?"''

''"This music of yours...." Kalina pointed at the music player producing unintelligible low-pitched roars, "is heavy metal?"''

''"Yeah~ it's from Children of Bodom. Guitarists are the proud of Finland. I love it so much, bought every single one of their albums!" KP31 kept on talking about her hobby that directly contradicts her lovely image.''

''"Wait, Ms. KP31....."''

''"What~Does Kalina like Nightwish more?" KP expressed happiness through her face, "I have their CD as well~"''

''"It's not the problem..."''

''However Kalina's agonized look was never paid attention to.''

''"Come on, I'll give you this one to listen to, their latest album. The riffs in this one is super great~!"''

''"H-E-L-P-!"''

''Eventually the one who saved Kalina from the hell of rock was Comrade Papasha who came to the bar to clean up the mess while murmuring "Who the heck is playing noise here".

''Of course, the bigger problem emerging from her and KP31 in the bar is a later story to tell.''

------------------------------------------------

“哟，波波沙同志吗。来收拾昨天欢迎会留下的东西吗？”

吧台的格林娜瞟了一下从门口走进来的白衣妹子。

“……”

然而，走进门的少女只是用沉默回答着格林娜。

“怎么了吗？波波沙同志？”

“不要……”

“嗯？”

格林娜转过身，直到这时，这个笨酒保注意到面前这个可爱的女孩子。

和她气到发抖的身体和那个僵硬的笑容。

“不要把我跟那些讨厌的毛子相提并论！！”

刚刚来到指挥部的KP31非常不开心。

是的，非常不开心。

原本说好要来接自己的指挥官，因为什么原因没有出现在车站放了自己半小时的鸽子就算了，来到这里的第一个人就把自己跟那些讨厌的斯拉夫妹子搞混。

是的，KP31非常不开心。

“抱歉啦！这次就原谅我嘛。”

“哼！”虽然KP31还装作一副气鼓鼓的表情，但是很明显面前对面前这个笨蛋，她也没法真正生起气来。“再搞错绝对饶不了你哦。”

“你想喝点什么，这次算我的好吧～”

“小浆果果汁。”

“好！您稍等～” 转过身的格林娜从柜子里拿出一瓶这深受北方民族喜爱的饮料。

因为气候的关系从斯堪的纳维亚到高加索的北方民族在拥有伏特加之前也习惯用这种果汁酿酒。

“明明习惯和喜欢都差不多。”格林娜小声念着

“怎么了吗？”身后那个少女的声音让自己意识到差点又说出肯定会惹那孩子生气的话了。

“啊啊～没什么”端过来果汁的格林娜赶紧转移着话题“说起来，KP31是今天才到指挥部吧。”

“是的哦，原本说指挥官会来车站接我的。结果居然放了我鸽子呢。哼～”

“啊哈哈哈，昨晚的晚上聚会闹的太晚了，看着我们的指挥官现在应该还在休息吧，啊哈哈哈哈。”

当然事实上昨晚是因为9A91的欢迎会因为突发事件草草结束，留下的酒精饮料被PK那个酒鬼喝光的同时，还把来迟的指挥官灌到不省人事的事情……还是别跟她讲了吧。

顺带一提，那个肇事人今天早上跟什么事都没有似的参加了晨训，真心怀疑这些毛子的胃是什么做的。

“哼，就是这样，也该让谁过来接一下啊！害我找了半天才走过来。”

“啊哈哈哈～ 是呢，不知道是谁负责这个事情的啊。”当然，实际上被拜托了这个事情的自己今天早上也没有准时起床，直到刚才才想起来有这么一出的事情就更不能告诉她了。

果然还是赶紧转移一下话题吧。

“说起来KP31喜欢些什么呢，你应该是指挥部里第一个来自芬兰的人呢。看后勤是不是给你准备些什么东西。”

“唔，那就给我准备一点盐腌鲱鱼罐头就好啦。”

“诶！？”

“噗，逗你啦。其实我自己也很少吃那个的啦。”

“呼，还以为你认真的呢。”要是这个芬兰妹子真的在食堂打开一罐鲱鱼罐头不知道要会多大的事情。

“真是失礼啊。你们这些南方人就知道拿我们的传统食物开涮。明明碱渍鱼还挺好吃的。”看到自己松了一口气的表情，KP又嘟起了自己的小嘴。

“啊嘞？？？”如果没有记错那个碱渍鱼可是用烧碱做的诶，真的没关系吗。

“不过说回来，格林娜小姐喜欢听歌吗。”

“芬兰的音乐吗，之前听说过。听过几个民谣蛮不错的！”

“我今天还带CD了，来听听吧。”

“好呀！”格林娜看起很兴奋的样子。毕竟芬兰的音乐一直评价还蛮高的。

5分钟后

“KP31小姐？”

“怎么了，格林娜小姐”

“你这个……”格林娜指着那个正在发出不能听懂的低吟狂吼声的播放机，“这是重金属吧？”

“对啊～‘死神之子’哦。芬兰引以为傲的吉他手，我超喜欢哦。每张专辑都有买的！”KP31一脸开心的谈论着和她可爱的形象一点都不符的爱好。

“等等，KP31小姐……”

“怎么～格林娜更喜欢‘夜愿’那种类型的吗？”KP圆鼓鼓的脸上露出幸福的笑容“她们的CD我也有哦～”

“不是那个问题.....”

然而KP31并没有注意到格林娜痛苦的表情

“来，我给你听这个，他们最新的专辑哦。这张里的快弹超棒的！”

“救～命～啊～！”

最终把格林娜从摇滚地狱里救出来的，是一边念叨着“谁在这里播放噪音啊”一边准备来酒吧打扫昨晚残局的波波沙同志。

当然说出这种话的波波沙和KP31在酒吧里因此吵起来的事情惹出了更大的麻烦，就是后话了。
