'''Seo Yuzuki'''（Japanese:{{Ruby|瀬尾|せお |ja}}{{ruby|結月|ゆづき|ja}}） is a character in the manga ''[[Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun]]''(or ''Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun'').
== Basic Informations ==
'''''Seo Yuzuki''''' ({{lj|瀬尾結月}},Yuzuki Seo), is Sakura Chiyo's friend who is popular among their classmates and she is often asked for help on various extracurricular activities. However, her brash personality often makes people feel offended. 

She has an older brother named Seo Ryosuke, a university student who works at as a waiter and cashier in a cafe.

Her Chinese name is  '''濑尾结月'''(Làiwěi Jiéyuè).
== Appearance ==
Yuzuki is an attractive teenage girl with naturally wavy, shoulder-length greenish-blonde hair that is swept to the side in a ponytail and secured by a brown scrunchie in a loose ponytail (When untied, it reaches around her breast level), brown eyes that has a slight reddish tint, which appears amber, an average height and an ample bust.

Her clothes is the standard uniform - a white blouse tucked into a navy blue skirt. Her neck bow is red, as assigned to second year students, and she wears a blazer on top. She wears her uniform in a much more sloppy fashion compared to [[Sakura Chiyo]]. Yuzuki's bow is the correct color for her year, but her skirt is shorter and she wears no socks.

However, when it comes to choir competitions, she wears her hair down and part of her hair is plaited. She is described as high-class and proper. She also wears socks in this case.

== Personality ==

Yuzuki is someone who easily offends people unconsciously. Because of that,[[Nozaki Umetarō]] calls her "oblivious". Yuzuki demonstrates this obliviousness fully as shown in Episode 10, while watching the movie, where she paid attention only to the alien on screen and failed to notice anything else, even the plot. She also likes to pester [[Wakamatsu Hirotaka]] but that is probably born out of poorly displayed affection.

Yuzuki is shown to have no sportsmanship whatsoever in a comical way. When playing basketball, she would flout all the rules and annoy the other players by hogging the ball and laughing maniacally. However, it is also through this that the basketball team realizes the importance of teamwork and hence appreciate their team more. Thus, Yuzuki's participation in their games not only allows the basketball team to practice for when they meet an annoying opponent but also brings out the best in the team.

It is shown in the manga, that she does get flustered and embarrassed when she is complimented or confessed to.
