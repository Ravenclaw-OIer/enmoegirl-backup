== Introduction ==

The future servant of the future is the opening theme song of the second season anime of TV animation " LoveLive! Sunshine !! ",sung by Aqours . The song was released on October 25, 2017, but the full version was officially stolen in a TOKYO FM show on October 17.

The jump action at the beginning of the animated PV is similar to [[Aozora Jumping Heart]].

The two LLSS OPs are each a solo mode, and in this song, Shanzi and Yeba each have a solo. Does it seem that LLer will count 11 in the future?

Launched on October 15, 2017, Pure Properties. The first OP song with Pure attribute.

The translation of the national service name is normal: We already know the future.

2018 Japanese SIF Tournament

==== Difficult Hard difficulty ====
Are these three big stairs in the middle serious?? This is obviously a Hard.

==== EX difficulty ====
The density is quite high and requires hand speed. The difficulty level is almost the same as most EX. The 16-point triangle is simpler than HAPPY PARTY TRAIN.

The Random spectrum gets upgraded to 11-star, which is slightly more difficult than the normal spectrum.

==== Master difficulty ====
The finals of the 2018 SIF Tournament was be delivered on August 5, 2018.

The hardest part of this song is the continuous slip in front of the chorus, which is a test of eyesight. The difficulty in other places is not too great, but because of the high density of notes, it is very easy to explode Good and Miss, and you need to pay attention to hand speed.

In summary, this song is more difficult than [[MIRAI TICKET]].

None of the four finalists of the SIF Tournament saw FC.

==== Challenge difficulty ====
This is a difficult AC spectrum and requires a certain reading ability. Otherwise, a series of three bets will make you eat GBM.

The entire spectrum is still difficult in all AC spectrums.
