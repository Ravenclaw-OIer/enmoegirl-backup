==== Hard difficulty ====

==== EX difficulty ====
Such a cool song turned out to be a Smile song? !! [[Guilty Night, Guilty Kiss!]] is also a Smile song. It seems that as long as the song's name is guilty, it will be a Smile Attribute. [[Guilty!? Farewell party]] is also a Smile Attribute.

However, the rhythm of this music is quite confusing, so be careful.

==== Master difficulty ====
573 notes, it seems like a seemingly simple master, right?

The front of the book is based on many triple-strokes, and it is the second consecutive point of the player + a single point on the other side, and some second consecutive points even cross the position, but bpm is not high, it is not difficult to cope 11 stars Configuration.

But when it comes to the part before the chorus, especially in the place of 330combo, the handling is very tricky, followed by 3-2-8-7-4-6-5. Don't be panic by being deceived, there is basically no difficulty later.

Don't be fooled by its low note count, this is an 11-star upper score.
