==== Hard difficulty ====

==== EX difficulty ====
Because the point of the spectrum is on the background melody, it is difficult to see the timing of different key strikes when playing a song.

The random spectrum will be scrambled at the intermediate scatter, but the possibility of tricky configuration is very low.

The difficulty is all lower than 9 stars.
