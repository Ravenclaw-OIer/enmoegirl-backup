==Etymology==
In Chinese, "Moe" means "to sprout"。 <br>
The most common source says that in the late 1980s because "燃え" and "萌え" are both "moe", when Japanese people wanted to type "燃え(burning)"(This girl is so cute that my heart is burning), they often mistyped "萌え" . It's interesting that 燃 has a different meaning: passionate, in nowadays Chinese network language.
According to a Japanese dictionary, an anime girl that has "Moe" in her name(Sagisawa Moe) often shouts her name when she is in danger. Some funs thought it was interesting and began to imitate.
In another Chinese dictionary, 萌 doesn't only mean "to sprout", but also represents "the beginning" (the beginning to have others' attention). Others say when you see a cute girl, it is as if you are in spring, and your flower of love begins '''to sprout'''.
