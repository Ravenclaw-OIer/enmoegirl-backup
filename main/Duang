'''Duang''' is a Chinese neologism from Jackie Chan's advertisement for Bawang Shampoo in 2004.And it has became a meme.

== History ==
The word was coined in a notoriously bad 2004 advertisement for Bawang Shampoo in which Jackie Chan says, "...after filming, visual effects are added, the hair – <big>'''Duang!'''</big> – becomes black, very shiny and very smooth."

Unluckily,the advertisement was proved to be a forgery by CCTV the following year.

For the advertising [[kichiku]] spoof and video has it is often seen.What let "Duang" fire up again, is a video kichiku that uploaded by [[BiliBili]] up '''绯色toy''' in February 20,2015.(the video has received 210 thousand and 700 clicks and 7 million 485 thousand barrages.)

== The Original Of The Advertisement ==
当我第一次知道要拍那个洗发水广告的时候，其实我是拒绝的！因为我觉得......呀......你不能叫我拍、马上拍，第一，我要试一下，我又不想说......你拍一个广告拍完以后加了很多特技，那头发<big>'''Duang'''</big>！很黑！很亮！很柔！结果观众出来一定骂我，根本没有这种头发！这证明上面那个是假的......我说先要给我试一下。后来我经过也知道他们是中药的，而且没有那种化学成分的。那......洗了这个月......这个月下来之后呢......起码我用了很舒服。现在呢......每天还在用......我还给了我成家班用！来！来！来！大家试试看！那我就跟导演讲“拍的时候就拍！拍完之后，这个头发就是我的头发，就不要加，再加特技上去，加到没有就是这样子！我要给观众看到，我用完之后就是这样子，你们用完以后，也是这样子！

When I first learned to shoot the shampoo ad, in fact, I refused! Because I think ... ah ...you can not ask me to shotimmediately.First, I want to try, I do not want to say ... you shoot an advertisement after filming,visual effects are added,the hair – <big>'''Duang!'''</big> – becomes black, very shiny and very smooth.The results of the audience must call me out, there is no such hair! This proves that the above is false ... I said first to give me a try. Later, I also know that they are after the medicine, but not the kind of chemical composition. That ...washed this month ...this month after it ...at least I used a very comfortable. Now ... every day with ...I returned to my family classes with! Come on! Come on! Come on! Let's try! Then I told the director about "shoot time to shoot! After shooting, the hair is my hair, do not add, plus stunt up, added to not like this! I want audience to see ,I used up,it's like this,you used up,it's also like this!
