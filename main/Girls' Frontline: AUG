'''AUG''' is a character from the Tactical SRPG ES game '''[[Girls' Frontline]]''' developed by MicaTeam and published by Digital sky and its derivatives. She joined the struggle on May 20, 2018

== Historical basis ==

The '''Steyr AUG''' (AUG for ''Armee Universal Gewehr'' in German or "Army Universal Rifle") is a gas-operated, magazine-fed, selective-fire bullpup assault rifle developed in the 1960s to replace the StG 58 (FN FAL) the fielded by the Austrian military. The military demands an accuracy no worse than the Belgian FN FAL, a weight no more than the American M16, a length less than or equal to that of contemporary SMGs, and a reliability no less than the Soviet AK-47 and the AKM when used in adverse conditions. Three variants (rifle, carbine and LMG) were planned, with an SMG variant added to the family later.

Work on the new weapon was spearheaded by the subsidiary of Steyr-Daimler-Puch, Steyr-Mannlicher GmbH, AT, main designers of whom are Horst Wesp (designer of the Glock series of Pistols), Karl Wagner and Karl MÖser, while Colonel Walter Stoll supervised the entire process. The AUG uses a bolt group resembling that of the AR-10/15, but with a locking mechanism to improve reliability.

The Austrian Military compared the AUG with the FN FAL, the FN CAL, the Czech Vz. 58 and the M16A1. The AUG performed well, and was excellent in terms of reliability, target acquisition and muzzle rise. This new rifle passed technical and field trials before being adopted into service in 1977 by the Austrian Army, naming it the StG 77 ("Assault Rifle 77"). Serial production began 1978.

From then the AUG became a famed name, adopted by various militaries aside from Austria's own.

*Tunisia has been procuring AUG rifles from 1978 amounting to at least 70 thousand rifles.
*Oman started fielding AUG for its troops from 1982, with around 30 thousand rifles in service.
*Australia announced that the AUG was to be its standard-issue rifle in 1985, designating it the F88. Initially 67,000 were fielded, later Lithgow gained a special license for production and export, with production reaching 280 thousand rifles in the 1990s.
*New Zealand planned to equip the M16A2, but switched to the AUG to keep itself in line with Australia.
*Saudi Arabia started fielding the AUG in 1980, total number is around 100 thousand.
*Ireland adopted the AUG in 1988.
*There are also small numbers of AUG rifles in service in Malaysia, Argentina, Equatorial Guinea, Morocco, North Africa, Djibouti, Papua New Guinea and other countries.
*The M-19 guerilla movement of Colombia once acquired large batches of the AUG from Tunisia via Libya.
*The AUG is also fielded by the US SEAL, the Australian SASR and some of the British Police.

At the same time the AUG is also purchased by numerous security and law enforcement agencies worldwide, including the US Coast Guard. Few bullpup rifles get to be fielded by law enforcement agencies or spec ops units, but AUG makes an exception. It can be said that the AUG is the most commercially successful bullpup assault rifle up to date. Starting from 1997, Steyr-Mannlicher began manufacturing a new variant with Picatinny rails, the AUG A2. The Austrian military currently fields the StG77 A2, aka the AUG A3, while the weapon depicted in the illustration appears to be an AUG A1.

== Trivia ==
=== Setting ===
''As a T-doll, though she's capable of sensing the emotion of sadness, she does not possess the function to drop tears.''

''The scent of her flower replaces the dull smoke on the battlefield, giving her adversaries the most beautiful burial. She cannot express the grief in funerals, but makes death more seductive.''

''She feels safe the most when walking in the rain, and that's also when her smile can be most easily seen.''

I once thought, that only sadness makes one drop tears.....If I could express my feelings with tears...I must be bringing a tear rain.<br />呵呵……这里的花香，完全散发着和我相反的气息呢。我曾以为，只有悲伤的情感才会让人流泪……如果我现在的心情，也能用眼泪来表达的话……一定会止不住泪水吧。
