'''G36‎''' is a character from the Tactical SRPG ES game[[Girls' Frontline]] and its derivatives developed by MicaTeam and published by Digital Sky.

== Historical basis ==

'''H&K G36''' is a modern assault rifle introduced by Heckler & Koch in 1995, and fires standard 5.56x45mm NATO rounds. It is intended to replace the aging G3 in the ''Bundeswehr''. G36 utilizes a large amount of stainless-steel reinforced FRP material, lightening it.

=== History ===

HK submitted its G11 and G41 designs to the ''Bundeswehr'' in the 1980s, but work on the former halted due to the unification of Germany, while the latter was too expensive that it was rejected. Experiencing two failures, HK started to work on a new small-caliber assault rifle in the 1990s, codenamed '''HK50'''.

The Bundeswehr proposed to replace its 7.62mm-caliber G3s with a new service rifle. The Federal Defense Technology Institute then evaluated the numerous designs submitted. Many were eliminated for being unable to meet the standard requirements, with only the native HK50, the Austrian AUG and the British L85A1 remaining. The latter was eliminated first for its high stoppage rate. The press was optimistic on the then-famous AUG assault rifle, predicting that the AUG was to be selected. However, the AUG lost to the then-unknown HK50, for its two-stage trigger design (with a half-pull of the trigger on semi-auto and a full pull activating full-auto).

This led the Bundeswehr to choose the HK50 in 1995, and it demanded Heckler Koch to improve it, designating it as {{ruby|Gewehr 36|Rifle 36}}, abbreviated to simply G36. It works in a similar way to the AR-18, using a short-stroke piston gas system, and kept its bolt structure. However, it differs from the AR-18 in terms of the number of return springs, the design of the gas piston tube and the piston itself.

The G36 fires 5.56x45mm NATO rounds at a cyclic rate of 750 rounds per minute, with semi-auto, two-round-, three-round-burst, and full-auto available depending on the trigger group. It uses a rotary bolt, a short-stroke gas piston, more reliable than that of the M16, effectively reducing the number of stoppages. It sports good ergonomics, and supports ambidextrous operation. The AG36 40-mm grenade launcher can be mounted on the G36. On some occasions, a modified AKM type II bayonet from the former East Germany stockpile can also be mounted..

All models of G36 have folding stocks which do not hamper the operation of case extraction. The cocking handle is positioned above the receiver, and can be operated by either hand. The receiver is made of glass-reinforced polymer, and the gun does not require tools to maintain. The G36 mainly uses 30-round transparent plastic magazine, with studs to support horizontal stacking. It can also use the Beta C-Mag which houses 100 rounds. Though its magazine is similar in appearance to that of the SIG SG 550, the latter cannot be used on the G36.

Though possessing decent accuracy, the G36 is not the most accurate. Rapid-firing from 100 meters away on semi-auto yields a spread of 2-2.5 inches (5.08-6.35 centimeters), with the SG550 yielding a spread of less than 2.5 centimeters under the same conditions.

The G36 had numerous flaws exposed after years of use.

According to ''Der Spiegel'' of Germany in April 2012, the Bundeswehr proved via experiment that the G36 will experience a severe drop in accuracy after "'''continuously firing several hundred rounds'''" (note that this refers to firing a high number of rounds within a relatively short timeframe in high-intensity combat, but not firing cyclically, which would be problematic even for water-cooled heavy-machinegun barrels). ''Bild'' then verified this claim by referencing {{ruby|''Wehrtechnische Dienststelle 91''|the 91st Defense Technology Institute}} subordinate to the Bundeswehr. It is mentioned in a report to the Federal Defense Minister that “All G36s had their impact points deviating from their reticles in overheating situations, therefore unsuitable for safe combat with enemies 200 meters away". The Bundeswehr also deemed that combat would be extremely difficult if the weapon does not cool down after continuous firing at targets 100 meters away. But no open criticism is found by soldiers in combat.

In a following announcement by Heckler & Koch, H&K denied the criticism, and accused the testing conditions set by the Federal Ministry of Defense, calling it a "systematic" attack against H&K. It stated that the control weapon was still a Heckler & Koch product, instead of a competing product, and that it is hardly convincing to compare weapons of different classes and different calibers, while mentioning that the G36 was not made to provide sustained firepower in combat either.

The Federal Minister of Defense Ursula von der Leyen officially announced on 22 April, 2015 that the Bundeswehr would no longer purchase and use G36s, stating that it "has no future" in the Bundeswehr.

=== {{Spoiler|Conspiracy by the Federal Ministry of Defense and H&K}} ===
According to civilian tests the G36 is still capable of maintaining accuracy after expending 120 rounds cyclically, with no deviation from its reticle whatsoever. The spread at 50 meters is at 3 centimeters, while no related problems were found during its time in service. The Federal Ministry of Defense stated that the spread at 200 meters was at 0.5 meters after 60 rounds on full-auto, expanding into 6 meters at 500 meters, and subsequently prosecuted H&K for this. The Bundeswehr is currently in an equipment change period after 20 years, however the anti-military voices were prominent, with constant trouble of fund allocation. Attempting to replace the large number of G36s will only make it "have no future", with the replacements being HK416s and HK417s {{Spoiler|still HK}}, or the RS556 by Rheinmetall and Steyr {{Spoiler|family of AR-15}}. The Federal Ministry of Defense lost in court in September 2016 for not providing detailed-enough test reports of the G36, but the spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of Defense stated that this would not change its mind on replacing the G36.

=== {{ruby|Sinistromanual|Left-handed}} ===

When early teasers were released, what the T-doll was holding was an area not protected by the insulation layer, which can cause severe problems after firing, which was amended to what she looks now.

While to exhibit the ambidextrous operation-capable feature of the G36, she was set to be left-handed (from how she holds her gun). {{Spoiler|However her chibi version uses the right.}}

=== Height  ===

While a big sister-like illustration G36 possesses, she is, according to her creator, "According to T-doll-gun scale estimations, with the gun at 1 meters..... Emm..... Perhaps G36 stands at around 150cm, and is not a high-standing big sister......_(:3」∠)_", {{Spoiler|Which promptly brings us to the topic of the height of the German Queen (Smirk)}}

=== Long-sighted ===

While seemingly aggressive from the look of her eyes, she is just trying to see things clearly since she's a bit long-sighted. Not angry at all.

<center>Seems a bit cold but not a bad kid~!</center>}}

=== Lady-in-waiting (Head maid) ===

G36 might seem a bit cool and a bit aggressive, but in the German-T-doll-oriented Midnight portion of Episode 1 {{Spoiler|where she didn't really make an actual appearance}}, (the Midnight portion of Ep. 2 is American-oriented, that of Ep.3 being USSR-oriented, and lastly Episode 6 being Israel-oriented)

she made dedicated supplies for every single companion out for the mission, and handled problematic kids such as G11 and P7 just fine. She does her best as an adjutant to serve her commander as we can tell from her lines. These all indicate that G36 is an excellent maid who deserves her maid dress.

=== One of the Fake European Certifications ===

During the early Public Test phase, she was one of the rarest 4-star T-dolls, with many having their 5-star ARs nearing maximum level, but still missing G36 in their inventories. {{Spoiler|Harder to get than a certain 416 anyway. (Smirk)}}
