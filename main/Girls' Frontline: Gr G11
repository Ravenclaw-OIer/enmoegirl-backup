'''Gr G11''' is a character from the tactical SRPG ES game '''[[Girls' Frontline]]''' and its derivatives developed by MicaTeam and published by Sunborn Network Technology Co., Ltd. She is based on the Heckler & Koch G11 assault rifle.

== Historical basis ==
The military of various nations are keen on replacing their service rifles with small-caliber ones in the 1960s, but the West German army (''Deutsches Heer'') then did not replace their 7.62mm-caliber G3 rifles with 5.56mm-caliber ones. The army, Heckler & Koch and Dynamit Nobel reached to an agreement, considering that any and all small-caliber rifles cannot win over traditional rifles in terms of both quality and limitations. They turned to conduct research on caseless cartridges/rifles, which Germany and the US previously worked on with no fruit in WWII and after WWII, respectively, in an attempt to directly overtake the small-caliber system and work on a revolutionary caseless rifle system instead. This yielded the G11 caseless rifle system.

The {{ruby|West German Ministry of Defense|''Bundesministerium für Verteidigung'', BMVg}} developed a standard as the design requirements for this revolutionary infantry combat weapon, which hopes to greatly enhance the individual combat capabilities of West German soldiers. And the standard is as follows.

*Maximum length of rifle:<750mm
*Maximum weight (incl. 100 rounds):<4.5kg
*Ammo capacity: around 50
*Capable of highly-accurate 3-round bursts
*Effective firing range without adjusting sights:300m

The biggest problem lies in enhancing accuracy in live combat, as psychological stress often lowers firing accuracy. Also, statistics taken show that targets hit in the 3-round burst mode is lower than in full-auto, since the first round usually has the best accuracy, and the recoil from that round influences the rounds that follow, in addition to the fact that the 3-round burst mode fires 3 rounds with a single pull of the trigger. Research found that only when the rate-of-fire is raised to above 2,000 RPM can the accuracy in the 3-round burst mode be improved. Therefore, to achieve high-rate of fire burst capabilities, HK introduced a cylindrical rotating bolt to raise the rate of fire.

Initially, the caseless weapon system project involved only 2 companies, with H&K working on the designs and Dynamit Nobel on the caseless cartridge. These two companies are collectively named GHGS (From ''Gesellschaft für Hülsenlose Gewehrsysteme'', "United Corporation for Caseless Rifle System). Later on, German optics manufacturer Hensoldt/Wetzlar joined the GHGS to develop the 1x-magnification sight of the weapon. H&K came up with theory-proving prototypes, the Type 1 and the Type 2, and deemed the caseless system viable after they passed through technical verification at the end of 1971. NATO expressed interest in the caseless system in 1973, and hoped that the weapon can be handed over in April 1977 for trial in a military exercise, which prompted H&K to accelerate their research.

H&K developed their first prototype, the Type 1, which already had many distinguishing features found on the G11, and this is when the basic structure of the G11 was hammered down, including the magazine placed parallel and above the barrel, with the cartridge facing down perpendicular to the barrel, the bullpup layout, the optical sight doubling as a carry handle, and the 3-round burst mode with a rate of fire of 1,800 RPM and the full-auto mode at only 400 RPM. The BMVg was optimistic towards the prototype, and signed a contract with H&K demanding all research work to be finished in autumn, 1977.

H&K developed 5 prototypes from Type 1 to Type 5 from 1974 to 1977, but trials show that the system at the time immature to be issued to the troops, causing H&K to be unable to deliver it to the armed forces in 1977. Aside from the weapon itself, comparisons with the HK33 also revealed that the 4.3mm cartridge was prone to wind influences, having an accuracy far worse than 5.56mm cartridges. Experienced shooters firing at 300 meters yielded a result of a circular error of 1.8 meters. After testing the original 4.3mm and the newly-developed 4.7mm caseless rounds, H&K decided to modify their weapon to have a 4.7mm caliber from Prototype 6.

After years of work, the caseless system of H&K was getting mature. The Type 14 developed in 1981-1982 was deemed suitable for issuing to troops. The Type 14 was officially designated G11 by the ''Heer'' in 1986 (later G11K1). The G11 started trial productions in March 1987. The G11 used a unique rotary bolt, with single, 3-round burst and full-auto modes available. No iron sights were present on the rifle. The original version had a fixed 1x-magnification optical sight, which was replaced with a detachable one. The polymer magazine found on early prototypes had a capacity of 50 rounds, which was reduced to 45 rounds on later models. On both sides of the magazine well there were two slots for magazines, allowing a total of 3 magazines to be carried on the weapon at the same time. Later models also had a bayonet lug, and were able to accept bipods.

The model after this series of improvements was named G11K2, and was handed over to the armed forces for trials. It was found to have a 50% better accuracy in the trials in 1989.

After a series of trials, the Federal Institute of Defense Technology deemed that the caseless rifle, technologically, had reached the level at which it was suitable for issue. The ''Heer'' announced that the G11K2 had reached the need for armed forces use and subsequently gave an order worth 60 million Mark on 4 April. It was reported that 1,000 rifles had been delivered by the end of the year.

But in the very same year, the Berlin Wall fell, with the eastern parts in dire need for funds for construction, which, coupled with the dissolution of the USSR and the Warsaw Pact which reduced the threat, rifle replacement was not on the top of the list. As a result, Germany decided to no longer discuss the issuing of the G11 in mid-October, 1990, which abruptly ended the production, procurement and the issuing of the G11.

Though a cancelled project, H&K still attempted to export the G11 to other countries, but all attempts failed. It was rumored that only the spec ops unit of the ''Heer'' and of the US armed forces had equipped the G11K2 in extremely small numbers, but there was no evidence to prove it.

<poem>
''------------------------
G11 remembered, that she ought to be preparing her clothes for Halloween.
Perhaps technically not "preparing", since it was too troublesome. Just tear up the clothes and add a bit of bandage, and simply hold a pumpkin? Scent of Halloween? Check. Dressing as a ghost? Check.
------------------------
That's what G11 thought.
There was no way to reject commander's humble invitation anyway, and it seemed ok to attend an activity in which there's candy to eat. But for all the rest, just pardon her.
------------------------
——So what's the deal with this?
G11 sat up, and looked around in confusion.
------------------------
Why am I in a pile of dirt after a sleep? Why there's a tombstone with "404NEET" carved into it behind me?
Did... HK416 actually thought that I was dead when I was asleep and dumped me?
------------------------
Nah, she won't. 416 won't set a tombstone for me.
------------------------
G11 tried moving a bit, and found a zombie placed by someone beside her... No, not a zombie, but a pillow.
And it looked a lot like the commander who hadn't bought a pillow for her and instead acted as a pillow last time.
------------------------
——Whatever, just hold it in the arms, must be cozy sleeping with it.
And that was when G11 discovered a box of rum-flavored ice cream beside the pillow, in front of the tombstone.
------------------------
Hmm.. Why does it look as if it is a tribute?
But.. quite tasty anyway.
------------------------
Tribute or not it's all fine, as long as there's something nice to eat, without UMP45 forcibly giving orders to me, and without HK416 dragging me out of the bed...
It's ok to just work your way through your life.
------------------------
“Wake up! G11！”
Just as G11 thought, the familiar voice shouted the familiar line.
------------------------
Ehh... It's common for life to get unlucky..
------------------------
That familiar devil's tear appeared again in front of her vision half obscured by the bandage.
That familiar figure once again raised a foot.
------------------------
Just as the scene taking place thousands of times was about to occur again,
Domp.
G11, who sat up straight in a flash, hit something.
------------------------
G11 scratched her head.
Ahh.. If remembered right, G11, after tearing up her clothes, saw a coffin for use for Halloween, and simply slept inside with the pumpkin, and hit the lid just now.
------------------------
So that was all a dream..
Quite sorry for that rum-flavored ice-cream..
------------------------
As G11 continued feeling sorry about that ice cream, an immature voice from outside the pitch-black world came in.
"Ala? Halloween has already ended, and what's this coffin doing here... Umm... better stow it away...."
------------------------
And the darkness was slit, the coffin lid sprung open——
G11 sat up, rubbing an eye, gazing into MP5 who just opened the lid.
------------------------
Perhaps.
If only MP5's face hadn't been as white as the bandage on G11 herself.
------------------------
“AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!”

(
------------------------
G11记得，自己本来应该是在准备万圣节的衣服的。
说是准备也不算是准备，因为太麻烦了啊。就随便的把衣服撕的破破烂烂的，然后加一点绷带，再抱个南瓜就好了吧？又有万圣节的气息，又符合扮鬼的需求。
------------------------
G11就是这么想的。
反正没办法拒绝指挥官的盛情邀请，有糖果吃的活动要参加也不是不可以，但要做其他事情的话，还是饶了她吧。
------------------------
——所以说这算怎么一回事啊？
G11坐起来，迷茫的看了看四周。
------------------------
为什么一觉起来，自己就在土堆里躺着了啊？为什么身后还有一个刻着“404NEET”的墓碑啊？
难道……HK416真的在自己睡着的时候以为自己死了，把自己给丢掉了吗？
------------------------
不，不会的，416不会给自己立墓碑的。
------------------------
G11尝试着动了动，却发现不知道是谁还在自己身旁放一个僵尸……不对，不是僵尸，是个等身抱枕。
而且像极了上次因为没给自己买抱枕而被迫成为抱枕的指挥官。
------------------------
——管他的呢，先抱了再说，抱起来睡一定很舒服。
也就在此时此刻，G11又在抱枕旁、墓碑前，发现了一盒朗姆口味的冰激凌。
------------------------
嗯，这怎么看上去那么像是用来祭奠自己的啊？
……不过……还挺好吃的。
------------------------
是不是祭奠什么的都无所谓啦，只要能吃上好吃的，还没有UMP45强行给自己下达命令，HK416来把自己硬拖起床来的话……
人生只要能舒舒服服地混过去就对了嘛。
------------------------
“起来！G11！”
G11正想着，那个熟悉的声音又吼起了这句熟悉的话。
------------------------
呃，人生不如意……十有八九嘛……
------------------------
那颗熟悉的恶魔泪又出现在了自己被绷带挡住了半边的视野前。
那个熟悉的身影又熟练地抬起了一只脚，
------------------------
眼看就要上演曾经经历过千百次的场景，
咚。
猛地坐起身的G11一头撞到了什么东西。
------------------------
G11揉了揉脑袋。
啊……如果没记错的话，好像是撕烂了衣服之后，G11看到了一个万圣节用的棺材，然后抱着南瓜就睡了进去，现在这一起身，就撞到棺材盖了。
------------------------
刚才的原来都是做梦啊……
可惜了那份朗姆口味的冰激凌唉……
------------------------
G11还惋惜着那冰激凌，漆黑的世界外却传来了一个稚嫩的声音。
“啊啦？万圣节都结束了，这里怎么还有个棺材……唔，还是收进去吧……”
------------------------
然后漆黑被划破，棺材盖被掀开——
G11顺势就坐了起来，揉着一只眼睛，和刚掀开棺材盖的MP5深情地对视着。
------------------------
大概吧。
如果三秒后的MP5脸色没有跟G11身上的绷带一样白的话。
------------------------
“啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！！！！”''

=== Hypnosia ===
A loli who loves to sleep, and is basically lazy or sleepy at any given time. The facecloth with a pig's nose depicted on it seems to hint about this, which, plus her directly asking the commander whether there's enough beds when she first came, casts some light on how sleepy she actually is. <del>But she won't come to a commander with bad luck.</del>Gr G11 sleeps even on battlefields. {{Spoiler|No this is a sign of <del>being broad-minded</del> strong psychology}}.

{{Hide|Title=Actually Gr G11 is quite formidable when she gets serious.|Text=
Gr G11's ability, "Assaulter's eye", when activated, can deal damage twice (for that of level 9 or higher, thrice) in a single shot, qualifying it as the prime offensive skill. Coupled with the best rate of fire among ARs, even with a damage rating of B she can take the MVP with little effort. A veritable MG among ARs, without the need to reload. {{Spoiler|But this ain't the excuse for you to sleep on the battlefield!!!!!}}

Her teammates all expressed substantial reliance on Gr G11's firepower in Operation Cube. {{Spoiler|Especially the Gr G11-exclusive babysitter [[Girls' Frontline: 416|416]]}}

And in Episode 2 of the operation, Gr G11 managed to destroy [[Girls' Frontline: Hunter|Hunter]]'s maneuver systems with only four shots to shake off her pursuit. In the same episode, [[Girls' Frontline: HK416|HK416]] deemed Gr G11 capable of outright killing [[Girls' Frontline: Executioner|Executioner]]. <del>But instead Gr G11 was freaked out by Executioner, retreating in 416's arms.</del> At the end of Episode 3 of the operation, the limbs of Executioner were taken out, again by Gr G11. {{Spoiler|And Gr G11 and HK416 had a nice scuffle during the process.}}

<del>Of course, during the entire process, Gr G11 either demanded to be taken home or simply sleep, while eventually getting dumped by everyone (actually 416).</del> {{Spoiler|After all most of the distance covered by the Gr G11 was on HK416's back or being held in her arms.}}

{{Spoiler|Gr G11: Not that I want to sleep, but it's simply that I'm afraid that everyone may only need to sit back if I keep this eye open.}}
}}

=== Foodie ===
When MG5 threatened to fire 416 and Gr G11 in Episode 1-3N, Gr G11 was scared. But when HK416 expressed that with [[Girls' Frontline: UMP45|UMP45]] around they can just sit back and relax, Gr G11 came back to her usual self: "It's all sleep and no work anywhere." But when [[Girls' Frontline: MP5|MP5]] took out a box of rum-flavored ice cream to Gr G11 "originally made by [[Girls' Frontline: G36|G36]] for [[Girls' Frontline: MG4|MG4]]”, Gr G11 instantly "mutinied", saying that she would go anywhere G36 wanted her to. {{Spoiler|Now we have her favourite taste}} {{Spoiler|Leaving 416 alone.}}<del>So the entire nighttime episode was like giving food to eat.</del>
[[File:416与G11_Pid64128877.jpg|400px|right|thumb|

]]

=== The true love of HK416 (?) ===
Throughout the entire Operation Cube Gr G11 and 416 seemed to be in a scuffle, and HK416 became the means of transportation to Gr G11 (incl. carrying and holding). When encountering an explosion, 416 pushed Gr G11 to the ground and covered her from the explosion <del>in addition to almost breaking Gr G11's waist<del>

It can be inferred from Episode 1-3N that the duo works together for most of the time, and Gr G11 seems to take joy from playing pranks on 416 (such as that password).

===Weak digi-mind===
When fighting the enhanced Executioner in [[Girls' Frontline: Summer event 2016"Operation Cube"|Operation Cube]], <s>due to Executioner being too aggressive</s> she was frightened, and UMP9 shouted to 416: "Gr G11's freaked out by Executioner! 416! Carry her away a bit further!", 416:"Keep it on and G11's digi-mind would....". From these it can be seen that Gr G11's neural cloud appears to be relatively weak, and perhaps has taken damage previously{{spoiler|, which may have contributed to her sleepiness and bad self-regulation.}}

{{Cquote|Will concentrate and accomplish her mission in a cold way under UMP45's forced orders. However, she is prone to digi-mind breakdown when encountering unexpected situations, expressing a simulated personality not found on T-dolls.|Official collection of 《Girls' Frontline》artworks. VOL.1}}

As stated above, the neural cloud of G11 appears to be very weak, and this setting possibly takes inspiration of the G11's reliability, which was criticized by some.

Due to many technologies being incorporated ''en masse'' into the weapon (including microcaliber caseless cartridges, rotary bolt), there is no doubt in the G11's technological advantages, but at the same time this brought about low reliability and made it economically unfeasible, plus the contemporary international situation(using 4.73mm-caliber weapons when NATO is mass-introducing 5.56mm ones, the dissolution of the USSR), the G11 was never used in large numbers.

Nevertheless, the G11 remains an excellent weapon in terms of technology.

=== Pain of M4 ===
The "Assaulter's eye" of Gr G11, due to a bug, once appeared on M4 in test servers, which surprised test players, calling the AR squad as "invincible", as it makes up for the squad's mediocre stats and their echelon formation. However, the developers soon fixed the issues, clarifying that it was solely a bug, and no changes were to be made on the ability of M4.

{{Spoiler|M4 weeped off her tears, and went back to making deliveries.}}

===Hobbies {{Spoiler|aside from sleeping}}===
In Operation Deepdive, Squad 404 trekked into Zone S15 (a contaminated zone), and mentioned topics related to zombies. Gr G11 revealed that she had been a fan of ''The Flying Dead'' for a total of 26 seasons, before the series abruptly ended with the outbreak of WWIII. Gr G11 also revealed that Biohazard-punk had been her favourite, and was looking forward to "the Bridging German Suplex in Episode 9 and the Seabed Zombie King who was injected with the {{ruby|ж|''zh'' as in vintage}} virus plus three liters of tyrannosaurus fetus. {{Spoiler|Before being commented on by 416: "Because the only difference between this shmuck and zombies is that she sometimes speaks human language.}}

So it seems unsurprising why she dressed as a zombie in Halloween.

Also she loves watching anime, and may repeat some of the interesting lines found in it. Once moved HK416 by saying "What you do don't represent you, 416". But after 416 found out that it was simply a line from an anime series, said <del>in disappointment</del>:"Now how can I count on this idiot..."

<br>Sometime before Operation Deepdive, she learned a phrase that's "so kawaii" called "[[Kan Colle:Yūdachi|PO...{{Spoiler|I}}]]" and wanted to say it out in front of 416, but was interrupted the next moment.

=== Sarcastic ===
After being warned by 45 of the severity of the situation, Gr G11 went serious and expressed her reliable side.

Still in Operation Deepdive, when [[Girls' Frontline: Destroyer|Destroyer Elite]] was showing off in front of Squad 404, Gr G11 sarcastically noted that Destroyer had only grown old for some years with more fat and longer bones, with her intelligence still in a decline. (Well that's one of the 404 indeed. xD)

And that's not only verbally. It can be easily seen in battle that the accuracy of Destroyer (Elite) was still low, and, though spectacular visually, she was not as powerful as everyone imagined, and can be easily defeated with little effort by commanders who got hold of her patterns.
