Overidea is an international mixed media project based on the universal worldview '''OR Universe''' which was written by the founder Kyouka. In 2013, Kyouka founded the media mix group Kikai Project and started publishing the novel ''[[Kikai Jikake no Akuma]]''({{lang|ja|機械じかけの悪魔}}, ''lit.'' Devil in Mechanical Device) on Japanese novel publishing site [[enwiki:Shōsetsuka ni Narō|Shōsetsuka ni Narō]] since 2014. From 2014 to 2018, Kikai Project published music videos expressing the stories of characters of the novel using [[VOCALOID]]. On January 2018, Kikai Project renamed Overidea, introduced the OR Universe and started publishing the new OR-Universe-based novel ''[[Soshite Kikai to Mahou Kara]]'' ({{lang|ja|そして機械と魔法から。}}, ''lit.'' After the Machinery and Magic) on pixiv FANBOX. From 25 June 2018 to 14 December 2019, [[Cierra Runis]], originally a character of ''Kikai Jikake no Akuma'', was introduced as the official [[poster girl]] of Overidea and started [[Virtual YouTuber]] activities. In February 2019, [[Mia Runis]] was introduced as Cierra's sister.
