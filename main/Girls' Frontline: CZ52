'''CZ52''' is a character from the Tactical SRPG ES game '''[[Girls' Frontline]]''' and its derivatives developed by MicaTeam and published by Digital Sky. She joined the struggle on February 21, 2018.

== Historical basis ==
The CZ 52 is a semi-automatic pistol designed for the Czech military by brothers Jan and Jaroslav Kratochvil at Česká Zbrojovka. It was adopted as the vz. 52 (where vz. stands for ''vzor'', or "type" in English). A total of around 200,000 units were manufactured from 1952 to 1954. The CZ 52 uses an unconventional roller-locked action (see below) which works similarly to that of the German MG42. It is chambered for the 7.62x25mm Tokarev cartridge and uses a single-action trigger. The CZ 52 has reliable safety measures. Aside from the manual safety, the spring-loaded firing pin ensures that dropping from heights with the pistol loaded will not misfire. However, due to the force exerted by the spring, the CZ 52 requires a trigger pull at 4 kilogram-force to fire, which is heavy for a single-action pistol. (For comparision, it usually requires a force of around 1.5 kilogram-force to fire a pistol.)

{{Hide|Title=Roller-locked action|Text=
The CZ 52 uses a short-recoil operation mechanism but with a locking mechanism unique among pistols, with the possibility of taking inspration from that of the MG42. The picture below is the slide of the CZ 52. Note that for simplification purposes, the return spring around the barrel has been removed. The pistol is in a cocked state, with the two rollers locking the bolt and the slide visible.<br>
[[File:Cz52 1.jpg]]<br>
When the pistol is fired, the recoil from the barrel moves all the parts backwards, while the barrel will only travel for a short distance, before being stopped by a lug in the receiver, as depicted below. The barrel then stops moving, while the remaining parts move on due to inertia.<br>
[[File:Cz52 2.jpg|614px]]<br>
The rollers then retract into the recesses in the bolt, unlocking the slide, which keeps moving to facilitate extraction before the return spring returns all the moving parts back into position, chambering another round and readying the pistol for another shot.<br>

{{Cquote|<center><big>'''''Due to how it was influenced by the MG42 GPMG, the CZ-52<sup>sic</sup> uses a roller-locked action uncommon for pistols. In ''Girls' Frontline, she's a calm and behaved T-doll with a dream to travel around the world, and highly values everything she has.''<br>(因为设计时受到了MG42通用机枪的影响，CZ-52采用了滚轴闭锁技术，在手枪中是十分少见的。在《少女前线》中，她是一名温和有礼的战术少女，她有着环游世界的梦想，非常珍惜自己拥有的一切。'''</big></center>
|''T-doll-pedia: 3-star HG "CZ52"'' (战术人形百科：三星步枪“CZ52”)<ref>[https://weibo.com/5611537367/G0XPAd31h?from=page_1006065611537367_profile&wvr=6&mod=weibotime&type=comment#_rnd1517402952100 T-doll-pedia: 3-star HG "CZ52" (in Chinese)]</ref>}}

====Prosthetics====
In the microblog with the Damaged-state illustration of the CZ 52, posted on 31 January, her illustrator replied to the question of why the left leg of CZ52 is a prosthesis: "'''''Because I'm a hentai with a weird sexual tendency.'' (“因为我是性癖奇怪的变态吧”)'''

===Substitute===
It was mentioned in the[[Girls' Frontline: Previous updates and login backgrounds#Offline update notice, January 25|offline update notice of January 25]] as: "''Added: 3-Star T-doll '[[Girls' Frontline: MP-443|MP-443]]', available for commanders through logins in February.'' (“新增：三星手枪战术人形“MP-443”，指挥官可通过二月签到获得。”)". However, illustrations of MP-443 were never released. {{Spoiler|However, it can be found through unconventional methods such as unpacking data.}}

Eventually, it was mentioned in the [[Girls' Frontline: Previous updates and login backgrounds#Offline update notice, February 01|offline update notice of February 01]] that: "''Adjustment: Changed February login T-doll from 3-star T-doll '[[Girls' Frontline: MP-443|MP-443]]' to 3-star HG T-doll '[[Girls' Frontline: CZ52|CZ52]]'''. (“调整：二月签到战术人形由三星手枪战术人形“MP-443”调整为三星手枪战术人形“[[少女前线:CZ52|CZ52]]。”)", spawning much speculation about the reason of the sudden change.

===Damaged-state illustration===
The illustration of CZ52 was released alongside the notice that MP-443 was to be replaced by her as the login reward for February 2018. However, her Damaged-state illustration was not released. Her illustrator, however, released the damaged illustration ahead of the developers.<ref>[https://weibo.com/songyuandu?is_all=1 @小吃_寒冰画将]</ref>

At the same time revealing that:
{{Cquote|<center>'''''The damaged version of CZ52 wasn't what it is right now, felt that the previous one was too ugly to look at, so just redrew at that moment. Inspiration is from how 水乌龟 plays his phone.'' (“其实CZ52的大破之前不是这一版本，后来觉得以前画的太丑了，就临时重画了，灵感来源是水乌龟玩手机的动作”)'''</center>
