'''Hatsune Miku (Japanese: 初音ミク)''', sometimes referred to as '''Miku Hatsune''', or Miku for short, is a humanoid persona voiced by a singing synthesizer application developed by Crypton Future Media.
==Name==
The name of the character comes from merging the Japanese words for first (初 hatsu), sound (音 ne) and future (ミク miku), thus meaning "the first sound from the future", referring to her position as the first of Crypton's "Character Vocal Series."<br />
Her name in Chinese is "{{Ruby|初音未来|chū yīn wèi lái}}" .<br />
Her codename of "CV01" means "Character Voice 01".

==Vocal==
Miku's vocal sample is provided by [[Fujita Saki]] after considering about nearly 500 vocal samples, because Fujita's voice is "clear and cute"（{{lj|分かりやすくかわいらしかった}}）<ref name="ITmedia">{{ja}}[http://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/0802/22/news013_2.html クリプトン・フューチャー・メディアに聞く（2）：「初音ミク」ができるまで (2/2) - ITmedia ニュース]. ITmedia. 2008-02-22 [2016-07-17]</ref>. When recording, Saki speaks at a "cute idol voice". The process took 2 days and 3 hours per day, and the recording context is meaningless combinations of romaji<ref name="jcast0101">{{ja}}[http://www.j-cast.com/2008/01/01015179.html 声優・藤田咲さんインタビュー（上）

In fact, the voice produced with the vocal is not at all similar to Fujita Saki's own voice, {{Spoiler|though she could imitate it anyway}}<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJrMC5pqGak 【声優の本気】藤田咲が初音ミクの中の人だと一瞬でわかる本人モノマネ！].

===V2===
[[File:Hatsune miku Append.png|thumb|Hatsune Miku Append illustrated by Masaki Asai]]

The official figure of Hatsune Miku(V2) is drawn by KEI. The reason that KEI was chosen is because CRYPTON thinks his drawings "transparent"<ref name="ITmedia" />. She has Aquamarine [[twintails]], and the clothing and the machinery are based on the DX7 synthesizer released in 1983 by YAMAHA<ref name="ITmedia" />. The red characters "01" on her left arm is set to be a QR code(Along with the supplement of her clothes by DIVA serie, the Logo of "01" would also be moved to proper positions or cancelled according to the features of the clothes), while the original setting of her suit is [[sailor suit]] but changed to the present design because CRYPTON was not satisfied with that<ref name="ITmedia" />.

the library of Hatsune Miku V2 was released on Aug. 31<sup>st</sup> 2007, and the prize was 15,750 yen, thus the day was defined as Miku's birthday<ref>{{ja}}[https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B000VCZ75A/ Amazon | VOCALOID2 HATSUNE MIKU | クリプトン・フューチャー・メディア | ソフトウェア 通販]. Amazon. 2007-08-31. [2016-07-18]</ref>。

Miku's voicebank at the begining suits idol pop and dance music the most, and has a optimum tempo of 70~150 bpm, a range of expertize of A3~E5<ref name="mikuv2" />。

There are at total 3 demo songs: ''ballade'', ''{{lj|かくれんぼ}}'' and ''pops''. None of the three songs is full verson.

===Append===
Miku used to have only one timbre after the first release, But on Apr. 30<sup>th</sup> 2010, the appending library "'''Hatsune Miku Append'''" was released, six timbres were added<ref name="mikuv2">{{ja}}[http://www.crypton.co.jp/mp/pages/prod/vocaloid/cv01.jsp VOCALOID2 初音ミク（HATSUNE MIKU） | クリプトン].

The official design of upgraded Hatsune Miku Append was created by Masaki Asai. The custom became more fictional overall ,and the twintail continued to exist while the earphone disappeared. The hair became greener comparing to the V2 version and the sleeves became tighter. The "01" LOGO on her left arm was retained, and the tie became imbedded in the doublet (which in the DIVA version is ON the doublet); the skirt was changed from the short pleated skirt of V2 to one consisting of the extention of the bodice and some fictional ornaments and widgtes attached to it, on the widget at the back of her waist, there is a black wire extending in the shape of tail(which was ignored by some versions of models). She [[shoeless|doesn't wear shoes]], and has a white foot ring with a "Crypton" logo on her left ankle.

===NT===
Due to the gap between the design concept of CV characters of Crypton and that of Yamaha (Yamaha hopes that Hatsune Miku V5 could imitate Fujita Saki's own voice), later versions of Hatsune Miku may not be named Hatsune Miku V5, instead, it will be named Hatsune Miku NT which is independently developed by Crypton.

At present, Few things were known about Hatsune Miku NT, we could only wait until March 2020, when the trial version is available.

==Nicknames==

*Leek girl: a nickname from ''[[Loituma Girl]]''. The song is origially an onomatopoeaia from ''levan Polkka'', a Polish folk. {{NeedsTranslation|有人制作了一个久保带人的《BLEACH》动画第二话中的一段画面：“满面笑容的井上织姬，手里拿着葱转个不停”，配上了这个选段，长26秒的Flash动画，就成了《甩葱歌》的鼻祖。而后有人制作了使用初音未来演唱的版本PV，动画中甩葱的姑娘换成了初音未来。这段PV一炮走红，从此''甩葱歌''和初音的葱娘之名便流传开来并广泛使用。}}

:It's said that Miku loves eating leek.

*Princess sama: Ryo posted a song called ''{{ruby|[[ワールドイズマイン]]|World is Mine}}'', the first sentence of the song is "世界で一番おひめさま" which means "No.1 princess in the world", so she is such called. <br />Thus lots of follower of Miku in Mainland Chian call themselves "knight".

*39: 8+31=39, "39"'s pronounciation is similar to that of "Thank You"({{lj|サン·キュー}}) in Japanese (That's how "39 kanshasai" comes from), There's also a way to read "39" in Japanese that is the same as "ミク".
