'''Type59''' is a character from the SLG game '''[[Girls' Frontline]]''' developed by MicaTeam and published by SUNBORN Network Technology Co., Ltd.

== Historical basis ==
The '''Type 1959 pistol''' was the Chinese copy of the Makarov PM built for close-quarters self-defense for commanding officers and police personnel. Construction started in early 1959 mainly by Factory No. 626 before the Type 1959s were experimentally distributed to commanding officers at regiment levels. However, due to multiple accidents occurring in the Type 1959's short service career, production ceased in 1960, with the Type 1959s retired from service.

The reason why the Type 59 was taken down from service shortly after being accepted into service was due in part to the relatively poor military production quality that accompanied the PRC's early years. Sino-Soviet relationship collapsed in the late 1950s, with Soviet technical personnel returning to the USSR, leaving only blueprints and samples behind. The Type 1959 was the product of a mere attempt to gain self-esteem.

The frequent problems plaguing the Type 59 arise from two factors; First is that the 7.62mm Makarov cartridge weighs 5.95g with a V10=290-315m and a maximum chamber pressure of 117MPa. Using the very same propellant found in that of the Nagant round, the Makarov cartridge possesed a low chamber pressure to maintain bolt weight and recoil within controllable margins. However, the Type 59 cartridge used high-friction steel casings rather than brass, which cramped up the virtual weight of the bolt. Cartridge manufacture was no easy work, which, coupled with few sophisticated ammunition testing facilities then, contributed to the variance in casing material, projectile diameter, propellant size, chemical composition, temperature, moisture and even propellant weight, which all resulted in great variances with the projectile itself. The unstable quality of propellant further contributed to the flaws, with cases like projectiles remaining in the chamber after firing a possible result. The Type 64 resolved these issues by raising maximal chamber pressure in every viable way to ensure reliability in firing the cartridge.

Second is that structurally the Makarov pistol avoided using plugs wherever possible to avoid related parts loosening; rotating axes are built directly into parts, which involves complex processes, high working hours and a high percentage of sub-par products. The hammer spring (which doubles as the trigger spring) and the sear spring have rather unique designs which when copied, due to insufficient metallurgy qualities and machining precision of the PRC in the late 1950s, rendered the part prone to metal fatigue, which again contributed to the malfunctioning of the Type 59.

Among these two factors poor ammunition quality is more prominent, as the Type 59 rarely encounters problems when firing Soviet-made brass cartridges. In the case of the Type 59 steel-cartridges however, a few shots may be safe if the weapon is well-serviced. But the severe dusting of the barrel, high temperatures and increased resistance from moving parts resulting from multiple prolonged uses of the same weapon during firing drills may result in the weapon malfunctioning.

Due to how the Type 59 had only less than a year between the start and termination of its production, it remains a rare item for a collector. The Type 59s commonly found on western civilian markets are actually dedicated civilian versions built by some factories contracted by Norinco after the 1980s (with serials beginning with ZZ the most common version, possibly built by Zhongzhou). True, military Type 59s built in 1960 have grips almost entirely engraved with five-stars-in-shield patterns, with some other Type 59s having the ''Bayi'' (八一, "August 1st") engraving being dedicated honorary weapons. Type 59s for export have a large star in a ring engraved to the grip (a feature self-distinguishing from military weapons, albeit with exceptions).

==Tips==
*Despite her skill being lesser and shorter-lasting than that of SPP-1, the Type 59 could be a viable substitute for the former as her flat 55%-75% evasion debuff makes hitting targets a trivial matter even for MGs.
*The formation buff and skill of Type 59 is largely similar to that of the FF FNP9, but more practical.
**Placing Type 59 in an MG/SG echelon somehow limits the total number of MGs, as she provides her formation buff only to those directly to the sides.
**However, other "insane output" echelons are also possible with Type 59, such as 4AR + Type 59 (to maximize benefit from formation buff) or 2MG + 2RF echelons.

==Trivia==
*Type 59's name in the index appears to be missing the middle space, as with all other T-dolls with their names beginning with "Type".
*Type 59 refers to herself as "T59" and simply "59" on different occasions.
*Type 59 may also have an addition towards her food as hinted by her possibly lie about not having stolen any.
*Type 59's quotes about the absence of Makarov may potentially be a poke on the two weapons' similarity to each other.
