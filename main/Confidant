|original=蓝蓝天空有着我和你
青青草原结伴的知己
好朋友 相遇相知
同闯天与地
路上跌倒我俩相扶持
遇上困难我俩不放弃
好朋友风雨不分离
最好知己
一起的时光
一起的成长
牵手勇敢前往
一起的泪光
一起笑容展
知己像阳光

蓝蓝天空有着我和你
青青草原结伴的知己
好朋友 相遇相知
同闯天与地
路上跌倒我俩相扶持
遇上困难我俩不放弃
好朋友风雨不分离
最好知己
一起的时光
一起的成长
牵手勇敢前往
一起的泪光
一起笑容展
知己像阳光
|translated=The blue sky contains you and me<ref>Translated by 毛舒驰, from http://5sing.kugou.com/fc/14778384.html</ref>
who are bosom friends on the green grassland.
Cronies who recognize after they meet,
breach the world together.
We help each other when we slip on the road,
and never abandon when we confront difficulty.
Pals never separate in the wind and rain.
The best confidant.
Collective time,
joint course of growth,
walk hand in hand with nerve.
Mutual tears,
common smile reveals,
bosom friend is like sunshine.

The blue heaven involves you and me
who are bosom friends on the green grassland.
Buddies who get familiar after they meet,
breach the world together.
We support each other when we tumble on the road,
and never renounce when we encounter trouble.
Pals never separate in the wind and rain.
The best confidant.
Collective date,
joint course of growth,
walk hand in hand with moxie.
Mutual tears,
common smile reveals,
bosom friend is like sunlight.
Collective life,
joint course of growth,
walk hand in hand with mettle.
Mutual tears,
common smile reveals,
bosom friend is like sunbeam.}}
