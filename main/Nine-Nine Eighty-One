|lyrics origin=上路
巩州遇虎熊
五百年前一场疯
腾宵又是孙悟空
失马
鹰愁涧飞白龙
沙河阻断路难通
福陵山中收天蓬

岭上
前行逆黄风
七星不照波月洞
千年白骨化阴风
鱼篮
网通天一尾红
紫金葫芦二道童
九尾老狐敢压龙

白虹坠
雪浪击石碎
思归
难归
堕回
轮回
月满一江水
前世莫追

福泽聚宝象
春风度不让洛阳
玉面狐折兰香
七绝崖上暗伏赤色大蟒
过西梁
女儿国鸳鸯罗帐
与三道斗法相
火云扬
明枪易挡暗箭难防

十方魔
渴饮着我的脆弱
凭你计法相迫
逐个击破要你识我本色
万里恶
摧垮了我的沉默
一肩担路坎坷
我不说
又何须旁人来嚼口舌

借扇
翠云访罗刹
碧波潭内结亲宴
招来九头的驸马
雾隐
金斑豹伸利爪
城北黄狮盗钉耙
白毛小鼠偷烛花

思乡
未敢听琵琶
摄魂曲后三股叉
一朝命断美人画
六耳
幻形难辨真假
太岁摇铃唤风沙
玉兔抛绣高台搭

红霓垂
九重紫云飞
久归
未归
欲回
恨回
凡胎恰登对
天命难违

比丘走白鹿
十三娘情丝缠缚
乌袍君生百目
庙前拦路自称黄眉老祖
将云拂
孤直公对谈诗赋
还未能抵天竺
金平府
钺斩红尘斧辟寒暑

众笔者
嘲笑着我的贪得
藏美酒有甚者
谁却敢说自己放肆醉过
休怪我
这半生痴情煞多
活一遭风流客
慕娇娥
但愿抱拥世间真绝色

浮世千寻沫
冲荡了我的轮廓
纵身入尘埃里
雷雨大作我也放声而歌
方寸中
方寸却不能定夺
七十二般胆魄
这次我决意不闪躲

世尊如来佛
诘问着我的执着
当年我瑶池刻
闹得痛快并未想过太多
状罪责
拿捏了我的业果
可顽心不服错
不思过
齐天大圣地上行者

那传说
忘却了我的寂寞
英雄名不堪得
何必较我混沌徒费口沫
这人间
毕竟我真正走过
一途平九百波
九千错
凌云渡成正果但我
有九九八十一种不舍
|lyrics translated=Set out on the journey,
fall into the Tiger's den in the city of Gongzhou
havocked in Heavenly Palace five hundred years ago,
the one riding on the cloud is again Sun Wukong
Lost the horse,
the White Dragon flies out from the Eagle's Sorrow Gorge
The River of Flowing Sands blocks the path to proceed.
Subdue the "Marshal Canopy" on the Mount Fuling

Upon the ridge,
walking against the yellow wind
The shine of the Seven Stars is not able to reach the Moon Water Cave.
The one-thousand-year-old white bone has turned into a devilish wind
Guanyin's Fish Basket
covers the sky and captures the Red Cyprinus
Two Taoist kids hold the Purple Gold Gourd and the Suet Jade Flask
while the nine-tailed vixen dares to subdue the Ocrean Dragon

The fogbow falls,
the waves dash against the rocks
Reminiscing about the past
Hard to go back,
Turning into demon,
The cycle of death and rebirth
The waning moon sinks into the river,
who would find their pre-existence?

The happiness is brought to the city of Elephantia.
This spring scene rivaled the beauty of Luoyang
The Jade-faced Vixen is picking the fragrant orchids.
An enourmous python is hiding on the Mount Seven Perfection
Enter the country of Western Liang.
The Woman Nation is overwhelmed with net of beauties and curtains of thin silk
Match magical powers with three Taoist Immortals
summoning up the clouds of fire.
An frontal attack is easy to block but a stab in the back is hard to guard against

The demons in all sides
thirst for my frailty
under attack of magic powers,
break them up one by one, I'll let you see my true identity
The evils within thousands of miles
force me to break my silence
Bear all the burdens on my shoulder along the journey,
If I said nothing,
then why do I need others to comment on

Visit the Demonic Lady
at Mount Turquoise Cloud for borrowing the fan
The Bull Demon King hold the banquet with his relatives in the Green Wave Pool.
This attracts the Prince with nine heads
Hidding in the mist,
the Leopard with flower-patterned coats stretches out his claws
On the moutain North of the city, the Tawny Lion Spirit planed to steal the rake.
The White-haired Mouse Spirit secretly ate Tathagata's candle

Feeling nostalgic,
have been afraid to listen to the Pipa
What follows the soul-seizing melody is a keen trident.
The beauty transformed by the scorpion is eventually killed
It's hard to distinguish
the Six Eared Macaque from his transformations
Tai Sui rings his bells to conjure the dust storms.
The Jade Rabbit throws the embroidered ball from top of the pavilion

The red skirt flutters,
the purple clouds fly over the high heaven
Long path to come back.
Still haven't come back.
yearn for the return.
Hate that it has not returned
Mortals just met the the right one,
the destiny is inevitable

In Bhiksuland, a white deer has walked pass.
The seven spider spirits entwines Pigsy in Gossamer Cave
The Taoist with a jet black robe has hundreds of eyes.
The one blocking the way in front of the temple called himself the Yellow-browed Buddha
Wipe off the clouds,
Guzhi Gong discusses poetry with Tang Seng
Still haven't reached Tianzhu.
In Jinping Prefecture.
The battle-axe owning by Kings of Cold and Heat Protection slashs off the the world

Many bards
are mocking my greediness
what's more I also collect good wine,
who dare say that they have been truly drunk in front of me?
Don't blame me
for being so spoony half this lifetime
Live as a dissolute person lust after Chang'e.
All I wish is
to hold world's most beautiful woman in my arms

My silhouette has been washed off
and faded in this turbulent world
Jump straight into the dust.
Despite the furious thunderstorm, I will still sing loud
In a short time,
I could not make up my mind
With my seventy-two transformations,
this time I decide not to dodge

The bhagavat Buddha
queries my stubbornness
In those years I inscribed my name at Jade Pool.
A havoc in heavenly palace, I didn't really think too much
List my sins,
this decides my retribution
Yet my stubburn heart will never admit defeat,
never reflect on mistakes
Great Sage, Equal of Heaven. The walker upon the earth

My loneliness
has been forgotten in that legend
I don't deserve the name of a hero.
There is no need to argue about it
After all,
I have walked across this world on my own feet
A journey that pacified nine hundred tribulations,
Made nine thousand mistakes.
Even though I have reached the Western Heaven and become immortal
There are still nine thousand nine hundred eighty one reasons for me to linger about
