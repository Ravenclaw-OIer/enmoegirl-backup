"'''A Millennial Menu of China'''" is an original Luo Tianyi song that was featured as one of her demos. The song is about the Chinese cuisine and promoting the culture. Many characters from different franchises made guest appearances in the PV, including [[Yuezheng Ling]]. The song helped form a popular headcanon that Tianyi is a glutton.

The image at the end is a reference to many of [[bilibili]]'s memes, including but not limited to [[Billy Herrington]], [[Ronald McDonald]], and [[Ge Ping]].

This original full version was featured in Tianyi's first official album, [[SingSingSing]]. The remastered version was uploaded on July 13, 2012 and reached over 100,000 views on bilibili. In April 2016, the song hit 1 million views on bilibili.

|original=小笼包
叉烧包
奶黄芝麻豆沙包
大肉包
菜包
还有灌汤包

事在人，命在天
亘古滔滔转眼间
唯席上
千年崇吃永不变

北京烤鸭
麻婆豆腐
蒜泥白肉
担担面
酸辣粉
还有那炸酱面

兰州拉面
鄱阳湖闸蟹
海南文昌鸡
烤乳猪
东坡肉
再上拔丝土豆

和你一起去周游
其实我只想到处吃个够
大江的南北通通尝个透
却不敢让你知道
怕你会嫌弃
你会受不了

云吞面
麻辣烫
羊肉串
蟹壳黄
静静的
悄悄的
让老板打个包

世界很大很乱，地球在转
数不清各种悲和欢
总是想太多还不如什么都别想
简单的吃一顿，再一餐
吃的那双眼都发亮
然后做运动，消耗掉，多余的脂肪

哦！烧卖糯米鸡
哦！爆筋牛肉丸
油炸糕酱排骨
黄金扬州炒饭
你不吃是不吃
你不吃也得吃
就放弃抵抗吧，一起吃

驴肉红烧，江米扣肉
糖醋里脊，老虎爪驴打滚
别忘了臭豆腐

四喜丸子，鸭血粉丝汤
过桥米线，烩面煎饼果子
还上番茄炒蛋

云吞面
麻辣烫
羊肉串
蟹壳黄
静静的
悄悄的
让老板打个包

世界很大很乱，地球在转
数不清各种悲和欢
总是想太多还不如什么都别想
简单的吃一顿，再一餐
吃的那双眼都发亮
然后做运动，消耗掉，多余的脂肪

五千年的文明，多么灿烂
留下食谱世界最长
花落人断肠，吃不了，那真叫忧伤
简单的吃一顿，多一餐
我们共同的小愿望
一起奋斗吧，战胜那，万恶的脂肪

哦！凉糕热干面
哦！猪肉炖粉条
回锅肉炖酸菜，还有兰州烧饼
让我们一起吃，全世界都得吃
就不要挣扎了，趁热吃

Char siu bun
Sweet bean paste filled baozi
Big pork pau
Vegetable baozi
There's also soup-filled baozi

Starting to do something is man's work,
successes and failures depend upon heaven
From acient times, for ever, in a moment
Rice meals are served at any banquet. It hasn't changed for a thousand years

Peking duck
Mapo doufu
Boiled pork with garlic sauce
Dan dan noodles
Hot and sour rice noodles
There is also Zhajiangmian

Lanzhou lamian
Poyang lake chinese crab
Hainan wenchang chicken
Roasted baby pork
Sweet and sour pork
I'll also serve stewed potatoes and sugar

I'll go and trip around with you
In fact, I just want to eat to my heart's content here and there
At the north and the south of Yangtze river, I'll eat up everything
Though I want to let you know
I'm worried that you might hate and abandon me
or you might think it's not acceptable

Wonton noodles
Malatang
Chuanr
Chinese pie with sesame
Quietly,
Secretly,
I'll ask the shopkeeper to have it ready

The world goes upside-down a lot, The earth goes round
There are so many sad things and happy things we can't count them all
It's better to not think anything than thinking too much
Get a bite to eat, have another meal
If you eat, your eyes will be bright
After that, we'll do exercise to burn away our unwanted fat

Ah! Shumai, sticky rice in lotus leaf
Ah! Steamed grounded beef gristle ball
Chinese donut, sparerib with soy sauce
Golden Yeung Chow friend rice
You don't eat, you don't eat this
You don't eat, I'm sure you'll eat
Soon you'll give up resisting, let's eat together

Donkey burger, Rou with sticky rice
Fried sweet and sour pork, old-tiger-talon, sweets with toasted soybean flour
Don't forget about stinky tofu

Soy-braised lion's head meatballs, duck blood and vermicelli soup
Crossing the bridge noodles, Henan braised noodles, Chinese pancakes
Also have stir-fried tomato and scramble eggs with them

White boiled shrimp
Buddha jumps over the wall
Fried swamp eel and union with wine and soy sauce
Pork, chicken and bamboo sprout soup
Quietly
Secretly
I'll ask the shopkeeper to have it ready

The world goes upside-down a lot, The earth goes round
There are so many sad things and happy things we can't count them all
It's better to not think anything than thinking too much
Get a bite to eat, have another meal
If you eat, your eyes will be bright
After that, we'll do exercise to burn away our unwanted fat

How brilliant the five-thousand-year civilization is!
It hands down the longest menu in the world
Flowers fall and people feel heartbreaking grief that they cannot eat them all. They really regret and lament over that they ordered
Get a bite to eat, have more meals
We have the same wish
Let's struggle together, let's overcome the heinous fat

Ah! Bean paste cake, hot dry noodles
Ah! Sautéed preserved pork with red vegetables
Twice cooked pork suan cai hot pot, There's also Lanzhou baked sesame seed cake
Let us eat together, I'm sure we can the whole world
Don't rush, Eat it before it gets cold
