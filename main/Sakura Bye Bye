==== Hard difficulty ====

==== EX difficulty ====
Song material 550, 2nd most after [[Beginner's Sailing]], water masses generally become green track the amount of the second song, a note sent. So how difficult is it?

First of all, this song has a lot of triangular stairs and three-level stairs, and there are many stairs that pass the 5th position. Since the BPM is not low, pay attention to changing hands.

Then there are two large steps from the 284th to 297th notes, the same configuration also appeared about 500-520 notes before the end of the chorus.

In general, the main difficulty of the whole song is the stairs, the others are not outstanding, and the difficulty of the median ten stars.

Random spectrum

The stairs were gone and much simpler.

==== Master difficulty ====
Will the big staircase become a double bet?
