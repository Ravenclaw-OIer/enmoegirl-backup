'''Stechkin''' is a character from the SLG game '''[[Girls' Frontline]]''' developed by MicaTeam and published by Sunborn Games and its derivatives.

== Historical basis ==

The {{ruby|'''Stechkin Automatic Pistol'''|'''Автоматический Пистолет Стечкина'''}} (or the {{ruby|'''АПС'''|'''APS'''}}, GRAU index 56-A-126) is an automatic pistol of Soviet origin, designed by {{ruby|И́горь Я́ковлевич Сте́чкин|Igor Yakovlevich Stechkin}} from the end of the 1940s to the start of the 1950s. It was accepted into service as the sidearm of combat officers and special forces.

The APS was designed in the No. 14 Central Design Bureau ({{ruby|ЦКБ-14|TsKB-14}}), with the first sample completed in 1949. The weapon was approved for service after factory and military trials, as well as the improvements that followed. The APS possesses a selector that enables the shooter to switch between semi- and full-auto.

The Soviet military deemed the Makarov pistol insufficient for self-defense for officers, special forces and vehicle crew who cannot rely on automatic rifles or carbines when they are forced to engage in combat, and instead issued APS pistols to them. However, the APS exhibited numerous problems in actual combat; the inconvenient stock, a size too large and a high amount of recoil in automatic firing. The angle of the grip was too small from vertical, which mandated some time for the user to adapt to, and also troubled firing in an emergency. The size was also a subject of complaint, as it was too large for carrying, and the need for the user to carry 4 full magazines (each loaded with 20 rounds) only worsened the problem. These issues ultimately culminated in the production of APS ceasing in 1958, and the APS withdrew from Red Army service in the 1960s (with the exception of special forces, grenadiers with RPGs and general-purpose machinegunners, who did not phase the APS out until the 1980s).

However, its better accuracy, lower recoil (in single mode), gentler barrel vibration and better firepower compared to the Makarov kept the APS in service within the KGB and the combat units of the GRU.

To combat the rising crime rate, the MVD proposed a need for a more powerful weapon sidearm than the Makarov pistol currently in service near the end of the 1980s. However, due to the lack of production of police SMGs then in the Soviet Union, the APS, as an acceptable substitute, was used by the MVD for a short time, and it is still welcome in law-enforcement agencies compared to other Soviet/Russian SMGs which fire the same 9x18mm cartridges.

After the fall of the USSR, the APS appeared in some small-scale conflicts, and is still the standard sidearm of Russian pilots who conduct sorties over Syria.

The APS had initially been designed for the 7.62x25mm Tokarev round, but was later switched to the 9x18mm Makarov round to suit the need of the Soviet military.

The APS operates on a simple blowback action, capable of firing in semi- and full-auto, which can be selected by a lever on the slide. It uses a double-action trigger with a capacity of 20 rounds. To counter the virtually uncontrollable recoil, a stock needs to be attached to the rear of the weapon to lower felt recoil.

The wooden stock can also be used as a holster when not in use, similar to that of the Mauser C96.

The APS was intended for use as an effective self-defence sidearm for use by artillery troops, tank crew and aircraft crew. The APS ''per se'' is indeed heavy for a pistol, especially when fitted with its stock. The weapon was later withdrawn from service to be replaced by the more powerful and more effective AKS-74U short-barreled assault rifle. However, it remains a pistol used by spec ops and law-enforcement personnel of some successor states to the USSR, but the stock as a holster is mainly replaced by tactical holsters for modernization purposes.

==Tips==
*Pair her with a high-damage low-RoF RF T-doll to boost damage output as her skill as well as formation buff is oriented towards RoF-boosting, which speeds up said RF T-doll's firing cycles.

==Trivia==
{{Cquote|
<big>'''''Outgoing and open, pretends to be cute to outsiders, but otherwise a trickster. A shopping fanatic, will go any lengths to earn money. Often talks nonsense as if she's serious.'' (开朗外向，对外人装可爱，背地里很腹黑，狂热的购物爱好者，为了得到金钱不择手段，经常一本正经地胡说八道。)'''</big>}}

*Stechkin, although sharing her production timer of 55 minutes with P7, had a much lower rate of appearance than the other.
