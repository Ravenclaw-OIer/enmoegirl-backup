== Background ==
This song seems to be about the westernization of Japan, which happened during the Meiji Restoration. Despite having an upbeat, oriental track, the song contains rather dark themes, mentioning guillotines and ICBMs. In addition, the lyrics state things such as "Songs of lament go unheard" (嘆ク唄モ聞コエナイヨ) and "This is a banquet inside a steel jail cell" ({{lj|此処は宴　鋼の檻}}).

To celebrate the song's anniversary, it was re-released along with 8 different arranges in the album 1st ANNIVERSARY! ALL THAT "Senbonzakura" on September 12, 2012.

"Senbonzakura" was released as a single under the label KarenT. This song is also featured in the albums 5th ANNIVERSARY BEST, EXIT TUNES PRESENTS Vocalodream feat. 初音ミク, HATSUNE ROCK feat.初音ミク, Kurousa Works feat.初音ミク -黒うさP作品集-, V love 25～Brave Heart～, ボーカロイド超ベスト-impacts-, ボカロ超ミックス feat. 初音ミク, Hatsune Miku 5th Anniversary Best ～impacts～, 初音ミク-Project DIVA-F Complete Collection, 創造Endless, 桜, VOCA NICO☆PARTY, and Yoen Waso Emaki.

日の丸印の二輪車転がし
悪霊退散　ICBM

浮世の{{ruby|随|まにま}}に

千本桜　夜ニ紛レ　
君ノ声モ届カナイヨ
此処は宴　鋼の檻　
その断頭台で見下ろして

三千世界　{{ruby|常世之闇|とこよのやみ}}　
嘆ク唄モ聞コエナイヨ
{{ruby|青藍|せいらん}}の空　遥か彼方　
その光線銃で打ち抜いて

百戦錬磨の見た目は将校

希望の丘　遥か彼方　
その閃光弾を打ち上げろ

浮世の{{ruby|随|まにま}}に

千本桜　夜ニ紛レ　
君ノ声モ届カナイヨ
此処は宴　鋼の檻　
その断頭台を飛び降りて

千本桜　夜ニ紛レ　
君が歌い僕は踊る
此処は宴　鋼の檻　
さあ光線銃を撃ちまくれ
|translated=Intrepidly raising a plush revolution
Free and easy, an antiwar country

Pedaling a bicycle marked with the Rising Sun
Exorcising evil spirits

Running through ring roads,
Always busy to be on the move, no big deal
Boys and Girls, being incomparably strong in warring states 
As the way this transient world goes round

A thousand of cherry trees are under cover of night 
Your voice will not be heard
This is a feast, a steel cage 
Look down from the guillotine

Darkness of Eternal World, Buddhist Cosmology
A wailing song cannot even be heard
Far away is the indigo blue sky 
Shoot out with the raygun

Looks like a battled-hardened army officer
Going and coming on the way of Oiran
This guy, that guy, everyone, close in!
It's a march of saints, one, two, three, four

Passing through the gate of Zen Land of Bliss,
ceremonial cleansing from evil influence
Surely the curtain will be drawn with a happy ending 
Between applause

A thousand of cherry trees are under cover of night 
Your voice will not be heard
This is a feast, a steel cage 
Look down from the guillotine

Darkness of Eternal World, Buddhist Cosmology 
A wailing song cannot even be heard
Far away is the hill of hope 
Set off the flash bang

Running through ring roads 
Always busy to be on the move, no big deal
Boys and Girls, being incomparably strong in warring states 
As the way this transient world goes round

A thousand of cherry trees are under cover of night 
Your voice will not be heard
This is a feast, a steel cage 
Jump off the guillotine

A thousand of cherry trees are under cover of night 
You sing and I dance
This is a feast, a steel cage 
Now, shoot up the raygun
