Winsor McCay(1867-1934) was the first one to develop the concept of “Full Animation”, that is to create and indicate 3-dimensional space in plane animation. It opened up a new path for the development of animation and heralded the era of American-style cartoons.

In 1914, McCay presented ''Gertie the Dinosaur'', the famous classic works in the history of film. In 1918, McCay produced ''The Sinking of the Lusitania'', the first animated documentary film in the history of film.
