There were two magazines called ''Oriental Cartoon'' (東方漫畫). One was a semimonthly magazine published by Shanghai Oriental Press from Apr 1934 to May 1934. The other was a monthly magazine edited by New Art Cartoon & Comic Society, printed by Shanghai Oriental Press, and published by Wuzhou Press from from 1936 to Aug 1937. The two magazines basically had the same cartoonists, including [[Ding Cong]], [[Hua Junwu]], [[Xu Jin]], [[Lu Shaofei]]. Besides reflecting the general social life, they also touched or even focused upon sharp political issues.
