== Writing Instructions ==
*In the general track and special song column, the difficulty level is displayed as: EASY / NORMAL / HARD / EXPERT / MASTER, where the EXPERT list contains two difficulties: the difficulty of EXPERT and the difficulty of EX-RANDOM.
*In the column of special difficulty songs, the difficulty level is displayed as: EXPERT + / CHALLENGE. Because the difficulty is relatively special, these two difficulties are listed separately, and the current distribution status is attached.
*EX-RAN, the EXPERT random spectrum, is a special type of EXPERT difficulty. The number of notes is equal to the EX difficulty but its position is not fixed, so it is very stimulating and challenging.
*EX-RAN songs are presented at Technical difficulty in SCORE MATCH, and random spectrums appear randomly in the third, fourth, and fifth rounds of the Challenge Festival. EX-RAN difficulty songs are also part of EXPERT difficulty.
*EXPERT+ difficulty, that is, the EXPERT spectrum with a sliding key, is also a special EXPERT difficulty spectrum. The note number is different from the usual EXPERT difficulty. You can use it as an exercise for the sliding key spectrum. EXPERT+ Difficulty currently in the distribution, please check in special difficulty songs.
*MASTER difficulty is currently the highest difficulty after installation (Note: some tracks have higher level CHALLENGE difficulty, which belongs to the SIFAC linkage spectrum, please find the specific matching songs in special difficulty songs).
*The following table lists the difficulty stars and Combo of all the songs currently in difficulty.
*The table below shows the distribution of all ordinary songs, special songs and songs of special difficulty, and is updated in real time.
Songs with swing notes will be marked with "{{#var:*}}" after the Combo. However, the EXPERT+ difficulty itself is all with a slide key, so the Combo of EXPERT+ difficulty songs will not be marked with "{{#var:*}}".
*At present, the distribution of special songs only writes the data of the difficulty of the distribution, and other difficulties are replaced by "-".
*If there are no special instructions for the MASTER track assigned for the current special song, please refer to the column of the master track that is being assigned for a limited time in the special track.
*The explanation of the difficulty page of the EXPERT, MASTER, EXPERT +, and CHALLENGE songs on the song page is for your reference only.
