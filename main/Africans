'''Africans''' refer to the people who live in Africa. It is also used for the indigenous people who originate from and stay in Africaã€‚

== Meanings ==

Africans have the highest human genetic inheritance diversity.

Even so, most people think about being poor and in poverty when Africa is mentioned. However, a number of African countries, such as the South African Republic, have their GDP ''per capita'' higher than that of Mainland China, until being surpassed around 2014.

Genetic and developmental studies have since 1940 gradually elimated the racist "White/Black/Yellow" category system. To this day, some people still use the highly prejudiced word "negro" to refer to all dark-skinned people, which is inaccurate and incorrect to do.

Currently, related studies divide African people into three sub-groups: '''Nigerians''', '''Bantu''' and '''Bushmen'''.

== Devised meaning ==

This word is used for players in the gaming society who "have bad luck", "do not have enough to spend", or both, and is derived from "being black-faced".

The use of the word "African" with such meaning dates back to the card game "Million Arthur", and is later applied in webpage/mobile games such as "LoveLive!", KanColle which '''have extremely high reliance on random chance'''. Another term, the "AfriCom" (African Commander), was derived from the word in Kancolle. {{Spoiler|And even the upcoming ''Assassin's Creed:Origins''  have its equipment divided into rarities, combined with random drops, signaling that African assassins are soon to appear.}} {{Spoiler|Hopelessly hammering the fate of Africans that they stay in their Africa.}}

This type of players share some ''very'' distinct traits:
:'''Bad luck in RNG--Spending large quantities of time and even money, yielding only low-rarity characters/equipment.'''
:'''Bad luck in combat--Matchmaking against high-level players; Suffering heavy loss with easy-to-pass low-to-medium difficulty levels.

With the first being virtually the only criterion that differentiates Europeans from Africans.

== Europeans ==
This term refers to the relatively rich people who live in Europe or America, and is used as the antonym for the gaming-society term "African" to refer to players who "have extremely good luck" or "ample to spend".
