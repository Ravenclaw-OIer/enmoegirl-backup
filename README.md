First, please fork this repo, and make changes there. You are suggested to clone a copy of it to your own computer. If you are new to GitHub, you can check out "The Hello World Guide" they provided to know how to play around here.

Please create a folder for each namespace on MediaWiki, use `main` if there is no prefix (main namespace).

Please upload your files with the suffix `*.txt`, and **DO NOT change the names** of the pages. For example, template pages should be put under the `Template` folder, and named as `Template:XXX`, where XXX is the template name. The same rule works for all folders excluding `main`, where no file name prefixs are required. For example, page `LoveLive` should be put under `main` and named simply `LoveLive`.
